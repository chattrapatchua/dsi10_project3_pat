Hope you enjoy\\n\\n**Meat, the Neighbors**\\n\\n**His Greatness, General of Worlds, Herd Leader of the Proud, Tim\\'Niregarded**\\n\\n\"This will be a momentous occasion. Our Fourth First Contact. Write that down, make sure the journalists use capital letters. So do we welcome them to the herd or start shooting?\"\\n\\n\"General, they refuse to answer our questions. They insist on a meeting in neutral space. We are not to attempt any landings on the Human worlds. They seem enthusiastic about meeting us, just a little paranoid.\"\\n\\n\"Typical herd behaviour. Perhaps they have not eradicated all their predators yet. Very well. We will meet them as they wish.\"\\n\\n**The Human** delegates arrived at the station. All outgoing communications immediately shut down.\\n\\nA single human entered the meeting room. Covered head to foot, showing only it\\'s paws, five digits, no talons. Definitely a herd species.\\n\\nIt introduced itself. \"General, I am Ambassador Rince. I will represent humanity in these discussions. I am afraid no communication with your empire is possible until we conclude.\"\\n\\n**His Greatness, General of Worlds, Herd Leader of the Proud, Tim\\'Niregarded**\\n\\n“You may call me Tim”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “Thank you, Tim. I am here with grave news. The information you have provided us about your glorious empire has excited and intrigued our people. However, we fear contact between our worlds will lead to violence. I am here to help prevent that.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** “ We seek no dispute with you! Your people are as welcome to share the vastness of space as our other allies. We come in peace. Please, whatever issue you have, let us resolve it here.”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** began removing his headscarf. “I am afraid I ordered the doors sealed for this. Please try and remain calm. I promise you that we wish you no harm.”\\n\\nAt the sight of the two forward facing eyes the Ambassador revealed, Tim\\'Niregarded felt a panic he had not known since he was a calf. Only one type of creature had eyes like that. He was trapped with a beast. They had not eradicated their predators, they were the predators. What madness had he inflicted on his herd. A space faring evil. They were doomed, all doomed.\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ Please General, Tim, we are here to secure peace between our people. When we received your information we were surprised, more than surprised, that our neighbours were all herbivores. It had never occurred to us that such a thing was possible.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** resisted the urge to run. He was a soldier, he had stood before enemies before and held his ground. If he was slaughtered and eaten in this room, he would keep his pride. Also the door was locked.\\n\\n“What do you want of us Predator? We will not be food! We have destroyed any that would prey upon us before and we will do it again if necessary. The Herd is strong.”\\n\\nHe knew he was lying. The moment his people found out that millions of space borne predators lived next door, they would flee. Chaos would descend on the worlds.\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “Perhaps now you understand the caution in how we chose to meet you. We are not, as you put it, Predators. Simply we have evolved from an omnivorous species. Our food now, is of course, entirely ethical, even by your own standards. Your dismay is what we seek to avoid. If your people react like that, there will never be peace between us.”\\n\\nAt that Ambassador Rince fully revealed his face, laying the cloth on the table between them. He sat quietly, allowing the general time to gather his thoughts. He began pouring the tea that his staff had thoughtfully provided.\\n\\n“Perhaps I can offer you a cup? I find it calms the nerves. We call this blend Earl Grey, although i have no idea why. It is perfectly safe for your species.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** accepted the cup. If all else failed it would serve as a weapon. The unnerving stillness in Ambassador Rince wasn’t helping. He felt emotions long dismissed by his people. The fears of a child. The fears that his kind had felt in the long battle with those that regarded them as prey.\\n\\n“Fine words. Your face is the face of our darkest fears. I do not trust you. Your teeth, your eyes tells me what you are. No. I know why you hid yourselves from us. You wait in ambush like all your kind.”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ I am authorising you and you staff full access to our data net. Please be aware that it is uncensored and, to be honest, smutty. You may search our history. There are terrors there. Even for us. We are not what we were, we have found peace after many battles. As did you. The difference is that we fought ourselves. The door is open General, please consult with your staff. My people will remain in seclusion until we meet again.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** watched as his staff uncovered horror after horror. Thousands of years of murderous greed. Those closest to his species were slaughtered and eaten or breed to imbecility to serve the perverse tastes of these creatures. Everything on this twisted planet was a predator.\\n\\nThen it began to change. They found peace amongst themselves when they gained space. New worlds, new technologies freed them from the chains of a deathworld. They retreated to the cities, rebuilding the wild planet they had inherited. Herds roamed free, challenged only by their natural predators. Food was created by machine. Disgusting forms of protein still, but now no pain. No hunting. No killing. They proudly recorded that no animal had been killed for food in a thousand years. A bizarre boast.\\n\\n“ Inform Ambassador Rince that we need to meet.”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “I am grateful that we meet again. It gives me hope for the future. How may I help?”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** “We have studied your past. My staff are of the opinion that you pose no threat to us. I do not concur. However, we are neighbours and, despite your disgusting habits, we must come to some arrangement. Since you have had longer to consider this than I, what suggestions do you have?”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ Tell me General, what is your people’s proudest moment? The one you still celebrate every year? From your information it was the burning of the last den of, well, wolves would be the closest thing we have. Your people killed them all. Correct?”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** “Yes, finally our people were safe. Our greatest achievement!”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ Am I right that you had achieved space travel by then? That you numbered in the billions? I am afraid what you celebrate would be regarded as the ultimate crime by our people. \\n\\nYour ongoing massacres of any meat eating animal would lead to war if my people found out. I’m afraid that until your species learns to peacefully coexist with other creatures we will have to restrict your access to our space. This station will serve as our only meeting place. Such a pity.”',\n",

If your people react like that, there will never be peace between us.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At that Ambassador Rince fully revealed his face, laying the cloth on the table between them. He sat quietly, allowing the general time to gather his thoughts. He began pouring the tea that his staff had thoughtfully provided.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps I can offer you a cup? I find it calms the nerves. We call this blend Earl Grey, although i have no idea why. It is perfectly safe for your species.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; accepted the cup. If all else failed it would serve as a weapon. The unnerving stillness in Ambassador Rince wasn’t helping. He felt emotions long dismissed by his people. The fears of a child. The fears that his kind had felt in the long battle with those that regarded them as prey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine words. Your face is the face of our darkest fears. I do not trust you. Your teeth, your eyes tells me what you are. No. I know why you hid yourselves from us. You wait in ambush like all your kind.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “ I am authorising you and you staff full access to our data net. Please be aware that it is uncensored and, to be honest, smutty. You may search our history. There are terrors there. Even for us. We are not what we were, we have found peace after many battles. As did you. The difference is that we fought ourselves. The door is open General, please consult with your staff. My people will remain in seclusion until we meet again.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; watched as his staff uncovered horror after horror. Thousands of years of murderous greed. Those closest to his species were slaughtered and eaten or breed to imbecility to serve the perverse tastes of these creatures. Everything on this twisted planet was a predator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it began to change. They found peace amongst themselves when they gained space. New worlds, new technologies freed them from the chains of a deathworld. They retreated to the cities, rebuilding the wild planet they had inherited. Herds roamed free, challenged only by their natural predators. Food was created by machine. Disgusting forms of protein still, but now no pain. No hunting. No killing. They proudly recorded that no animal had been killed for food in a thousand years. A bizarre boast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“ Inform Ambassador Rince that we need to meet.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “I am grateful that we meet again. It gives me hope for the future. How may I help?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; “We have studied your past. My staff are of the opinion that you pose no threat to us. I do not concur. However, we are neighbours and, despite your disgusting habits, we must come to some arrangement. Since you have had longer to consider this than I, what suggestions do you have?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “ Tell me General, what is your people’s proudest moment? The one you still celebrate every year? From your information it was the burning of the last den of, well, wolves would be the closest thing we have. Your people killed them all. Correct?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; “Yes, finally our people were safe. Our greatest achievement!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “ Am I right that you had achieved space travel by then? That you numbered in the billions? I am afraid what you celebrate would be regarded as the ultimate crime by our people. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Your ongoing massacres of any meat eating animal would lead to war if my people found out. I’m afraid that until your species learns to peacefully coexist with other creatures we will have to restrict your access to our space. This station will serve as our only meeting place. Such a pity.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

The humans had literally stumbled their way onto the galactic scene, a simple one-planet species and barely civilized. Their lifespans were little longer than those of their ancestor apes and outside the backwater planet (that they insisted on calling \\'Earth\\', even if most of its surface area was covered in water) they had only the tiniest of settlements. Into citadel space they had come with simple iron ships that brute-forced their way through the dimensions to achieve faster-than-light speeds. When they had made first contact, they actually had to send a ship back to inform their people because they didn\\'t have any way of communicating instantaneously over even tiny distances in space. Grudgingly their civilisation was acknowledged by the council, our vote was not behind that.\\n\\nIt only made them become the most annoying peddlers of the galaxy. The galactic council was based on contracts between the many species in citadel space. Contracts that were debated, evaluated, negotiated, rewritten and refined usually over a hundred cycles before there was any hope of approval from both sides. How could these simple beings with a lifespan not even half that understand these proceedings? They didn\\'t, the humans rudely ignored all that and just send envoys out to offer pacts and agreements no one cared about. \"The humans are here\", we said with annoyance, tired of their many times they stood on our doorstep to attempt feeble diplomatic discourse. More out of pity than anything else we gave them some scraps and FTL communication technology (in the hopes they would at least stop visiting in person) and signed off on their worthless offerings.\\n\\nOne thing that was noticeable about them was their hardiness. Coming from a world with a vast range of climates, they could adapt to practically any living conditions encountered on other citadel species worlds. And for some reason they enjoyed moving across half the galaxy to live in a jarringly different culture (gleefully adopting whatever outlandish social rules these had). Within not even one of their lifetimes, they had people living on the many thousands of planets of whatever species foolishly allowed them to come. We saw these places marred by the presence of these over-enthusiastic apes and whenever one of the popular destinations of our people was overran with them, we turned away with disgust and said \"The humans are here.\" Our own planets were kept clean of them and we did not allow them to settle anywhere in our space.\\n\\nMore cycles passed as we noticed a new trend. The younger ones of our people began seeking the fortune in the stars, away from the stability and security of our civilized systems. We found the cause of that to be the humans. They foolishly jumped headlong into colonizing barely habitable planets, surviving only because of their hardiness. Surprisingly, they then set the groundwork to terraform them, working on creating conditions other council species could survive in as well. These colonies were flocked to by many, promising a honest life for hard work and offering cheap living space even for the largest of families. \"The humans are here\", became a call for willing settlers, assuring every being of a safe haven that could be shared by all.\\n\\nAs the humans went forth to tame the most dangerous regions of the galaxy, they brought back a wealth of resources. Bypassing the galactic council again, they began trading with anyone willing. Within another one of their short lifetimes they had built a network of exchange that rivalled the official citadel platforms. We could not avoid joining into trade with them, as they offered the most coveted of wares from many different cultures that had previously been hidden behind unfinished agreements, some for thousands of cycles. As one of our planets after the other established trade routes with the humans, with hidden joy we said \"The humans are here\" when their ships turned up on our ports, promising a new influx of goods and wealth and leading to new prosperity for all our people.\\n\\nThat upswing ended abruptly when in a political move (that had not thought to even be possible) we were exiled from the galactic council. An opponent pushed us into disgrace in front of all the citadel species, instantly severing the many millennia old pacts and cutting our access to the FTL travel network. In less than a cycle our civilisation was practically shattered to pieces, each planet on its own and powerless to defend itself against the planned invasion from our opponent. With travel blockages set up in all our systems it was clear that utter annihilation was their set goal. As we stood before our ruin, a representative of the humans contacted us to offer their aid and protection, pointing at the treaties we had long since forgotten about. We thanked them for their honour and refused as we were staring at death and there was no need for them to pointlessly die with us. They did not listen and sent their iron battleships that circumvented the blockages through their brute-force FTL travel method. Their considerable military might was hitherto unknown. And as they jumped in by the ten-thousands in all our inhabited systems, we cried out \"The humans are here!\", with tears in our eyes and rekindled hope. They stood with us steadfast, weathering countless strikes before our opponent gave up the direct approach in frustration.\\n\\nIt took many cycles before we were able to re-establish formal communication with the galactic council and many more to clear our species from the false allegations before we could finally reinstate the old contracts. Back in power, we pinned the blame at our opponent and from that we gained leverage that we immediately used to incite the greatest assembly of political leaders in the history of the galactic council. Now we stand before all of them to invite the humans into the citadel and onto the podium. Our trade partners, our allies, our friends.

       "     'selftext': '\"Quartermaster! What is this filth?!\" A voice snarled down the hallway, echoing past Lieutenant Tash\\'s desk. Swell. This promised to be \\'enjoyable.\\'\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\"Look. I know that lot fight like the last Kree in the starvation-pits. And their weapons make some of our engineers need counseling for nightmares or theological objections. But this. *This*. I am *certain* this violates a fistful of treaties, and would be called unrighteous by even the adversary-dieties of every known religion. I *know* my understanding of the physical sciences indicates it shouldn\\'t be possible.\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\"Be that as it may, trooper. But Fleet Medical cleared it as compatible with the majority of the combined forces. And our supply lines have been compromised. Repeatedly. But the Humans have shown uncanny guile and aptitude in ensuring that enough of these reach our front lines to keep the front from crumbling.\"\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\"Still. Sir. What kind of species could think up something like *this?* By accounts, their planet is *overrun* with life. Like most others, there\\'s weather. Climates. Active geology. Apex predators, and aggressive microorganisms. Everything that every other race needed to be nudged to develop. More severe and varied than some of our more…\\xa0 fortunate races. But still. How could a species with all that going for it, come up with… *this*?\"\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n\"Be glad they did, trooper. It\\'s saving our collective butts. Though… you\\'re not the first to voice concerns. Some including fleet brass. And chaplains. We pushed back to the Humans, and eventually they provided what they said was an *extremely* non-regulation manual on the care and usage of this… product. We were suspicious about some of the claims made in the document, but several R&amp;D divisions back in the core territories have gone through and confirmed every usage. On top of what it says on the label, these can be used as various types of improvised explosives, three kinds of projectile weapon, repair supplies for a half-dozen vehicle and vessel subsystems, medical supplies for more than half the races in the Fleet, and, with certain kinds, a short-range communications system. There are also rare but confirmed reports of Humans successfully performing rearguard actions against overwhelming numbers using these.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n“Okay. Fine. So this… Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide is chock-full of non-regulation uses for these. That just drives home my point about their base use, sir. At least tell me that the supply lines have been secured, and we’ll be resupplying with shipments from sane races? I know the Humans are some of the core of our defense, and have been in the forefront of some of our roughest offenses. Could we get them back doing *that*, and leave the supply lines to some of our… less effective frontliners?”\\n\\n“The point remains. We need these. The Humans are the only ones getting them to us reliably. The Nemesis fleets know where most of our ships must pass through from our core worlds, to reach the Front. The Humans, with their darkspace stations scattered through the Void, have more options on getting what we need, where we need it. So until we can better secure our lines, we’re stuck with these. You don’t have to like it. I sure don’t. Each time I have to break one out, it hurts my soul. But without them, we’d be dead in space.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n“... Fine. *Fine.* Give me the Guide. But I’m not happy about this.”\\xa0 \\n\\n“You and me both, Trooper. You and me both.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n---\\n\\n*The trooper stomped off, grumbling, and started thumbing through the Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide for MREs. Page One, Rule One: Recipe 23 is for fresh recruits only. If you are issued Recipe 23, by any means necessary reallocate it.*\\xa0\\n\\n“I still don’t see how they could eat *any* of these … Emareees of theirs.”',\n",

And their weapons make some of our engineers need counseling for nightmares or theological objections. But this. &lt;em&gt;This&lt;/em&gt;. I am &lt;em&gt;certain&lt;/em&gt; this violates a fistful of treaties, and would be called unrighteous by even the adversary-dieties of every known religion. I &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; my understanding of the physical sciences indicates it shouldn&amp;#39;t be possible.\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be that as it may, trooper. But Fleet Medical cleared it as compatible with the majority of the combined forces. And our supply lines have been compromised. Repeatedly. But the Humans have shown uncanny guile and aptitude in ensuring that enough of these reach our front lines to keep the front from crumbling.&amp;quot;\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Still. Sir. What kind of species could think up something like &lt;em&gt;this?&lt;/em&gt; By accounts, their planet is &lt;em&gt;overrun&lt;/em&gt; with life. Like most others, there&amp;#39;s weather. Climates. Active geology. Apex predators, and aggressive microorganisms. Everything that every other race needed to be nudged to develop. More severe and varied than some of our more…\\xa0 fortunate races. But still. How could a species with all that going for it, come up with… &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt;?&amp;quot;\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Be glad they did, trooper. It&amp;#39;s saving our collective butts. Though… you&amp;#39;re not the first to voice concerns. Some including fleet brass. And chaplains. We pushed back to the Humans, and eventually they provided what they said was an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; non-regulation manual on the care and usage of this… product. We were suspicious about some of the claims made in the document, but several R&amp;amp;D divisions back in the core territories have gone through and confirmed every usage. On top of what it says on the label, these can be used as various types of improvised explosives, three kinds of projectile weapon, repair supplies for a half-dozen vehicle and vessel subsystems, medical supplies for more than half the races in the Fleet, and, with certain kinds, a short-range communications system. There are also rare but confirmed reports of Humans successfully performing rearguard actions against overwhelming numbers using these.”\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay. Fine. So this… Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide is chock-full of non-regulation uses for these. That just drives home my point about their base use, sir. At least tell me that the supply lines have been secured, and we’ll be resupplying with shipments from sane races? I know the Humans are some of the core of our defense, and have been in the forefront of some of our roughest offenses. Could we get them back doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, and leave the supply lines to some of our… less effective frontliners?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The point remains. We need these. The Humans are the only ones getting them to us reliably. The Nemesis fleets know where most of our ships must pass through from our core worlds, to reach the Front. The Humans, with their darkspace stations scattered through the Void, have more options on getting what we need, where we need it. So until we can better secure our lines, we’re stuck with these. You don’t have to like it. I sure don’t. Each time I have to break one out, it hurts my soul. But without them, we’d be dead in space.”\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“... Fine. &lt;em&gt;Fine.&lt;/em&gt; Give me the Guide. But I’m not happy about this.”\\xa0 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You and me both, Trooper. You and me both.”\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trooper stomped off, grumbling, and started thumbing through the Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide for MREs. Page One, Rule One: Recipe 23 is for fresh recruits only. If you are issued Recipe 23, by any means necessary reallocate it.&lt;/em&gt;\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t see how they could eat &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these … Emareees of theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

I know all too well how difficult it is to balance the wants and perceived needs of a diverse populace, made even more difficult by the truly alien nature of your counterpart’s. Indeed, I genuinely anticipate our continued debates on the minutiae of luxury goods tariffs. Unfortunately, taking both our great People’s economic interests fully to brain, I can not in good faith accept anything less than an equal border taxation rate on a long-term trade deal, regardless of the current trade imbalance.\\n\\nThe above being written, I do have a proposal in mind that could “sweeten the pot”. And please, forgive the backstory I am about to embark on, but I believe it fully relevant to our discourse.\\n\\nAs I am sure you are aware due to the exorbitant amount of media coverage the process originated, your predecessor gave several gifts to both my People, and me, at the beginning of her term. The specific gift this anecdote centers around is Maggie.\\n\\nAccording to my cultural advisors, Maggie was quite the appropriate gift. I fondly remember the first time I laid eyes on her, looking like a living lump of coal in her handler’s arms, intelligently taking in the sight and smells of a new world. Oblivious to the learned habits of her kin, Maggie quickly took to Dubrian traditions, licking those around her as a sign of affection.\\n\\nOriginally named Magnolia, a symbol of your Southern States, I settled on appropriating the human tradition of “nicknaming” her, in an effort to give myself a daily reminder of the people to whom I can thank for her presence in my life. An intelligent creature, she has cleverly associated my use of her full title with my displeasure with her malignant behavior.\\n\\nPer the included instructions, I housed her, fed her, played with her, and gave her a loving home. We Dubrians require daily exercise, much as you humans do, to maintain our physical fitness. I began including Maggie in these exercised once she reached her, admittedly large, adult size and weight at approximately one of your Earth years since her arrival.\\n\\nOur runs quickly became highlights of my day. They afforded me the ability to clear my brain, escape the trappings of my position, and reflect upon unbridled love. And what love did she give! I do not recall a single time she was not enthralled at my presence, as if I was the physical embodiment of her every want and desire. I do not need to bore you with details of the adventures we had together, oft to the chagrin of my protective escort, suffice to say they were numerous and each rank highly upon my personal list of happiest memories.\\n\\nLast week, coinciding with the height of our negotiative trade week, was our last such daily run. I know what you are thinking and no, she has not perished from this or any world – yet. But, her joints are no longer cooperating with her aging body, and my simplest pleasure is no longer physically possible for my best friend.\\n\\nAnd that is exactly what she has become. My best friend.\\n\\nI realize now what her handler meant when she handed Maggie off to me, saying “I give you Man’s best friend, in hopes that Humanity can become Dubrian’s interstellar friends.”\\n\\nWith this very personal anecdote in mind, I come to my proposal:\\n\\nAs stated previously, we require an equal border taxation rate on luxury goods imported between our nations for a period of fifty rotations of your Earth around your Sol. Additionally, we will willingly accept, paying all associated costs, any unwanted canines plaguing your nation’s animal hospitals and impounds. We promise to give them our whole brains, loving households, licks of affection, and, of course, daily runs.\\n\\nWill you allow your best friend, to become our best friend, and therefore make us friends?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nVolvap A.

Can you ask one of those guys\", I jerk my head towards the guards, \"to go ask the King if he would be so kind as to join us for a discussion of the situation?\"  I\\'m trying my very best to use polite and diplomatic language here, even if I have a feeling it\\'s not going to do much good, and it\\'s not my most well honed skill.\\n\\nFriday, who seems to be more positively disposed towards me, says something to the group of guards in that highly musical tongue of theirs.  Given that these guys all have fairly high pitched voices, and as with humans, the women are generally more high pitched than the men, it sounds halfway to a soprano solo every time she talks to them.  One of them sings something back at her, and turns around and heads out the door.\\n\\nI take a closer look at Friday.  What had at first seemed like blue eyes, I now note, have a slight purple tinge to them.  And what I had taken for platinum blonde hair, the sort you only see in certain Norse extractions, actually has a bit of a purple tone to it as well.  Looking over at Oz, I note that while I\\'d seen his hair as just the \\'white\\' of age, it has the same purple hint as well.\\n\\n\"Hey Friday,\" I open, \"I just noticed that you and the High Wizard\", (can\\'t hurt to at least *try* and assuage his ego a hair) \"have the same hair color.  Are you related, or is that a common thing among your people?\"\\n\\n\"He is my uncle.  My mother\\'s brother.  The ability to harness mystical energies is a thing that travels within my family, and is always accompanied by this mark.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, OK.  Interesting.  So, is that a particularly **rare** thing?  Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no.  I have no siblings.  My mother died bearing me, and my father never remarried.  But it is hoped that when I have children, one of them will carry the gift.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very sorry to hear that.  I hope for the best for you and your potential progeny.\"\\n\\n\"It is kind of you to say so.\"\\n\\nI continued, \"So, I\\'m obviously not familiar with your traditions here.  Is the leader always male, or is a Queen a possibility?  Does the King have any other children, another son or daughter?\"\\n\\n\"A daughter may become a Queen, if she is the one to inherit.  But the King has no other children.  His wife died during childbirth, and he never remarried.\"\\n\\n\"I, uh... Hrm.  OK, so, maybe I just have really bad luck, but that\\'s two women in a row you\\'ve told me about that have died in childbirth.  Is that sort of thing a frequent occurrence here?\"\\n\\n\"It is unfortunately quite common.  About one in thirty children have their mother die while bearing them.  So, for the most part, women will only have one or two children.\"\\n\\n\"One in ***THIRTY***?!\", I shouted, \"Holy ***FUCKBALLS!***  You don\\'t need me to save you from a fucking **dragon***, you need me to save you from atrocious medicine!  Where I come from, the maternal death rate is more like one in five **thousand**.  Ok.  Wow.  I mean, I\\'m just trained in emergency medicine, but, I am **really** going to have to talk to whoever is in charge of delivering children around here before I go.  OK, ok, before I get too sidetracked, you said the King only had one son, so who is next in line for... uh, guys?  Friday?  Oz?\"\\n\\nIt was around this moment that I noticed that both Oz and Friday were staring at me in pure, gape-jawed shock.\\n\\n\"Um, you guys OK there\", I ventured.\\n\\nI honestly wasn\\'t sure they had even heard me.  I snapped my fingers.  \"**Guys!**  You all right?\"\\n\\nOz seemed to recover a little bit.  \"You... you speak of miracles!\"\\n\\n\"No, you guys are speaking of **horrors**.  One in *thirty*.  That\\'s worse than the bloody Dark Ages.  Hell, one in five thousand isn\\'t even all that great.  Some countries, errr, \\'kingdoms\\', where I\\'m from, it\\'s down around one in *ten* thousand.  Then again, some of \\'em are lots worse, but even so, I think the **worst** are closer to one in sixty.  And that\\'s like, places that have been under constant siege and war for the last fifty years.\"\\n\\nFriday spoke in rushed words, \"If you could teach us this, that would be *far* more valuable than destroying the dragon!  I think even the King might agree, despite his rage and despair at the loss of his son!\"\\n\\n\"I mean, I\\'m happy to help out there.  I\\'ll need to talk to your healer over there, or your midwives, or, well, quite possibly all of the above.  But seriously, though, what does your line of succession look like?  As in, now that the King\\'s heir apparent has passed on, who would ascend to the throne if the King were to meet an unfortunate end?\"\\n\\nFriday thought about the question for a moment, before replying, \"The King\\'s younger sister seems most likely.  A half-sister technically, as the former King\\'s first wife\", I cut her off with a mildly acerbic \"Lemme guess, died in childbirth?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes.  It would most typically fall to her, although she is still quite young, having just celebrated her 500th, ah, I think the closest term in your language would be \\'season\\'.   Being such a youth, she has not yet had any children, of course, and typically, one cannot be named Queen without having born at least one heir.  Since the risk to mothers is so high, we prefer to crown those who are unlikely to pass away during birth, so as to maintain stability of rule.  Thus, the Prince\\'s son would also be a consideration, though he is barely 300.\"\\n\\n\"Wait, 500 seasons?  How long are these seasons?\"\\n\\n\"It takes nine days for the stars to circle once.  Call that a \\'week\\'.  Ten cycles of the stars is the period I am calling a \\'season\\'.  Four of those would be equivalent to your \\'year\\', or so?  Thus, the King\\'s sister is a mere youth of 125 of your years!\"\\n\\n\"OK, um, wow.  That\\'s the very longest any of my people live, pretty much ever.  And you say she\\'s still considered a youth?\"\\n\\n\"Well, 500 seasons is a fairly special occasion.  It is when one of our people is generally considered to finally be an adult.  Though just barely.  2500 seasons is what would be considered the average life expectancy if one avoids misfortune, though some have lived to see their 3000th season.\"\\n\\n\"Whew.  OK, lemme do some math real quick.  If 500 seasons is assumed to be about the equivalent of our 18 years, then 2500 seasons would be about 90, 3000 seasons would be like, 108, and the Prince\\'s son would be almost 11.  Yikes, OK, I can see why you\\'d have some issues there.  What are your infants like, the newborns?  Do... uh, wow, hrm.  Are you guys even mammals?  That is, I see that you are generally shaped like myself and Anneke here, with the same general differences between the sexes.  When your people give birth, do you produce nutrition for the infants from your breasts?  That\\'s a common feature of a whole class of different types of animals on my world, including us, the humans.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  Mothers produce milk for the first ten seasons or so after birth, by which time, a baby can eat a wider variety of foods, and walk, though not very well.  This is also about the time when a child will start learning to talk, again, not very well.  By their fiftieth season or so, a child will have developed the ability to be reasoned with, although they are still... child-like.  Between the fiftieth and four hundred fiftieth season, they will play with others of the same age group, and begin to learn a skill, and go through general education in the way of the world.  By the time they reach the five hundredth season, a child of my people will generally have become a mostly responsible adult, although still occasionally prone to passionate behavior and reckless action.\"\\n\\n\"OK, wow.  So a very extended adolecence.  Hey, Anneke, so, you might find the Prince\\'s son a good companion.  You\\'re what, 13 or so?\"\\n\\nAnneke gave me a mildly irritated look.  \"I\\'m **16**, thank you.  I know I look younger than that, but it\\'s true.  I will graduate from the Gymnasium next year!  My mother was also very petite.\"\\n\\nI took that in.  Between the tears and the stature, Anneke had looked more like a child to me, but now that I examined her more closely, I could see that her face had less of that shape, and was more like an adult\\'s, even if, as she said, she was quite small.  \"Hrm.  Um, what do you mean by \\'was\\' small?  If I\\'m not sticking my foot further into my mouth.\"\\n\\n\"My... my parents died a few years ago, in a car crash\", she replied, with a sad note in her voice.  \"I live with my cousins and my aunt and uncle, now.\"\\n\\n\"Oh\", I replied, eloquently.\\n\\n\"So perhaps I would do better making friends with the King\\'s little sister\", she continued, somewhat hotly.\\n\\n\"Indeed.  My apologies for assuming you were still a child, and for bringing up what must be a painful topic.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s... it\\'s fine.  I\\'m used to it.\"\\n\\nShe seemed less than fine, honestly, but I didn\\'t want to push it.  I turned back to Oz and Friday.  \"And you, ah, sir?  Do you have any children of your own?\"\\n\\nOz proudly replied, \"I have two children, in fact.  A boy and a girl, the first a fine young man of 920 seasons, and the second a lovely little girl of 240.  My son is right over there, in fact\", he gestured to the younger of the two apprentices assisting the healer, \"and he is fast becoming quite adept in medicine!  A fine career, though I must admit that I wish he had been born with the gift, so he could follow in my footsteps.  Alas, it was not to be.  But, my wife survived both births!  And if you truly can help us to save more of our mothers, wives, and daughters when they bear our children... perhaps I could have a third child.  And perhaps they might have the gift.\"\\n\\n\"As I said, I\\'ll be happy to discuss it with whoever is appropriate here.\"\\n\\nFriday looked like she was about to say more, when the soldier who had left earlier came back through the door, stomped his feet, and came to attention.  Everyone else in the room stood up, so I looked over at Anneke, \"Let\\'s try and make a good impression, shall we?\" and stood myself.  Anneke was up before I was, actually, but at 16, I doubted her knees and back were as bad off as mine.\\n\\nThe King, who had seemed like a moderately affable fellow when I dropped myself into his meal last night, looked rather less cheerful at the moment.  Well, hopefully that was because it was still fairly early in the day, and not a bad sign for the upcoming conversation.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9fumh/pi_a_demon_from_earth_a_youve_been_summoned/) / [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhzjxp/pi_a_demon_from_earth_ch_11/)',\n",

If I&amp;#39;m not sticking my foot further into my mouth.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;My... my parents died a few years ago, in a car crash&amp;quot;, she replied, with a sad note in her voice.  &amp;quot;I live with my cousins and my aunt and uncle, now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh&amp;quot;, I replied, eloquently.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So perhaps I would do better making friends with the King&amp;#39;s little sister&amp;quot;, she continued, somewhat hotly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Indeed.  My apologies for assuming you were still a child, and for bringing up what must be a painful topic.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It&amp;#39;s... it&amp;#39;s fine.  I&amp;#39;m used to it.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She seemed less than fine, honestly, but I didn&amp;#39;t want to push it.  I turned back to Oz and Friday.  &amp;quot;And you, ah, sir?  Do you have any children of your own?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oz proudly replied, &amp;quot;I have two children, in fact.  A boy and a girl, the first a fine young man of 920 seasons, and the second a lovely little girl of 240.  My son is right over there, in fact&amp;quot;, he gestured to the younger of the two apprentices assisting the healer, &amp;quot;and he is fast becoming quite adept in medicine!  A fine career, though I must admit that I wish he had been born with the gift, so he could follow in my footsteps.  Alas, it was not to be.  But, my wife survived both births!  And if you truly can help us to save more of our mothers, wives, and daughters when they bear our children... perhaps I could have a third child.  And perhaps they might have the gift.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;As I said, I&amp;#39;ll be happy to discuss it with whoever is appropriate here.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Friday looked like she was about to say more, when the soldier who had left earlier came back through the door, stomped his feet, and came to attention.  Everyone else in the room stood up, so I looked over at Anneke, &amp;quot;Let&amp;#39;s try and make a good impression, shall we?&amp;quot; and stood myself.  Anneke was up before I was, actually, but at 16, I doubted her knees and back were as bad off as mine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The King, who had seemed like a moderately affable fellow when I dropped myself into his meal last night, looked rather less cheerful at the moment.  Well, hopefully that was because it was still fairly early in the day, and not a bad sign for the upcoming conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9fumh/pi_a_demon_from_earth_a_youve_been_summoned/\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhzjxp/pi_a_demon_from_earth_ch_11/\"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Human-Amir was supposed to be resting and was instead insisting on spending time lounging in his family’s apartments in the hours before the Naming of his newborn nephew.\\n\\nThe sight of a tall man, dressed in the robes of one of Humanity’s desert people, embroidered with deep shimmering flames, was somewhat unexpected. \\n\\nAl’Mudhib. One of the Seven Djinn Kings.\\n\\nThe last time Vree saw this particular being, he was casually discussing the complete destruction of a species that dared to offend him with a dragon who was as old or older than Humanity itself.\\n\\nVree flattened his ears and tried very hard to hide behind his book. It didn’t work, there was simply too much of him, but he tried anyway.\\n\\n“You were kidnapped,” Al’Mudhib said in reply to his grandson’s surprise, and came over to examine Human-Amir carefully, tutting over his injuries. “Why did you not spend your Wish?”\\n\\nWish? What was a Wish? This must be yet another oddity of Humanity’s Other community, and now Vree was wishing for something to take notes.\\n\\n“I didn’t know if I would need it later,” Human-Amir admitted, as shamefaced as he ever got, and polite under the eye of his many-times-great grandfather. “I thought about it, but I decided to save it instead.”\\n\\n“You would not have had a later if you died, foolish boy,” Al’Mudhib scolded him, and snapped his fingers imperiously. All of Human-Amir’s injuries healed all at once, and he was suddenly in clothing very nearly as fine as Al’Mudhib’s himself. “There. And you-“\\n\\nVree remembered that he was trying to be a chair and did his best not to scramble for cover when Al’Mudhib’s eyes landed on him. \\n\\nHe did not want to find out what a djinn was, please. Human-Amir was bad enough when he was killing entire crews of pirates, and this great being was infinitely more powerful. \\n\\n“Sir,” he replied, and got to his feet, ignoring his trembling knees while he did it, and dropped his head politely. His official job at this event was to represent his people, and wasn’t *that* just a slammed door on the tail. “Greetings from Ha’reet, and my congratulations on your new grandkit.”\\n\\n“You’re so polite,” Human-Amir grumbled resentfully, but he sounded amused too. “You make me look bad.”\\n\\nVree flicked an ear at him but kept his eyes on the floor, offering no challenge-gaze whatsoever. \\n\\n“You *are* polite,” Al’Mudhib commented with something like approval. “And you do well at keeping my fool of a grandson out of trouble. I am told that you were the terror of your ship while seeking his rescue. I do not hold you responsible for his capture.”\\n\\nVree tried not to breathe a sigh of relief.\\n\\nVree definitely breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\nHe did not want Human-Amir’s terrifying grandfather to do something terrible to him. \\n\\nThe old not-a-human looked like the vindictive sort. It was probably for the best that Human-Amir killed all of the pirates who carried him off. Whatever his grandfather did to them would certainly have been worse. \\n\\n“Well,” he said at last, and clamped a hand on his grandson’s shoulder preemptively. Human-Amir wiggled somewhat, but Vree was pleased to see someone else scruff him for once. “Shall we go and meet the new child?”\\n\\n“You don’t need to drag me,” Human-Amir protested as his grandfather propelled him down the long hallway with Vree trailing after them for lack of anything better to do with himself. “I *want* to meet the baby!”\\n\\n“You always need to be scruffed.”\\n\\nHuman-Luka appeared out of a nearby door, for once garbed in a sharp-cut suit, the garb of a human royal, with a long red scarf around his throat rather than the tie most humans chose. He bowed his head politely to Al’Mudhib and came in for a hug from Human-Amir. \\n\\n“You look better,” he commented, and came for a hug from Vree as well, who scent-marked his head in return but refrained from grooming his hair. “Hullo Vree.”\\n\\nAlright, so maybe Vree was inclined to adopt Human-Luka too. He seemed much better-tempered than Human-Amir. How much worse could he be?\\n\\n“Hello, Imperial Highness,” Vree said, and chuckled when the young prince scowled playfully up at him. “When you told me that Carrier *Pacifica* was large, you failed to mention that it is the size of a moon.”\\n\\n“I thought you saw her after the Thraxxis War,” Human-Amir pointed out, and wiggled away from his overly-tolerant grandfather. “I mean, from a distance. I was on the *India* for that.”\\n\\n“I was on Occupied Ha’reet, defending my Pride.”\\n\\nThey entered another sprawling set of apartments, these rooms filled with a number of people who looked very much like Human-Amir and Human-Luka. \\n\\nHuman-Amir made straight towards a happy, although tired-looking, woman who might easily have been his twin for how much they looked alike. \\n\\n“Hi Hina,” he said, and kissed her cheek before making something he called ‘grabby hands’ at the tiny bundle in her arms. “Baby. Gimme.”\\n\\n“Wretch,” the woman, who could only be his older sister, Sahina and the mother of the child in question, said, and surrendered her tiny kit with only a little hesitation. “Remember to support his head.”\\n\\n“It hasn’t been *that* long since I held a baby,” Human-Amir complained, and cradled the child in his arms before returning to Vree’s side to show off his tiny, cooing prize. “I remember when Maggie was born. Lookit Vree. He’s the cutest little bug.”\\n\\nThe child was indeed adorable, as baby animals tended to be, and Vree leaned down to blink slowly at the child. The baby peered up at him through blue eyes, and immediately sneezed on his snout. \\n\\n“Definitely related to you,” he told Human-Amir, while wiping his nose carefully. To Sahina, he bowed the human way. “Congratulations on your kit. He is indeed adorable.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” Sahina beamed, and watched as Al’Mudhib claimed the baby next, ignoring Human-Amir’s protests that he wasn’t done. “Now all he has to do is survive our family.” \\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\nIf you like this, check out my masterlist at r/LeeHadanWrites',\n",

       "     'selftext': ' \\n\\nLike most stories, this one begins with three idiots sitting in a room full of aliens. FISTAHAT, the First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques, was the most prestigious damn music (and art) school in the galaxy, and we still had to sit through orientation. Most orientations however were boring. FISTAHAT’s New Species orientation was supposed to be all about welcoming members of the newest species who made it in. \\n\\nAnd Mankind was very new.\\n\\n“Welcome to NS Orientation,” the large, friendly pile of gray-green tentacles spluttered into the mic. “I am your professor, Laibach. You may call me Teach.\\n\\nI smiled. A professor who allowed us to call him Teach didn’t seem too bad. If I remembered correctly, this species was- damn, I forgot what it was.\\n\\n“In a moment, you will be paired up with some older students. You will spend the day together, and they will help you acclimate to your new situation. These ‘Buddies’ will help you learn the ropes of campus life”\\n\\nCool. As I looked at the various aliens clustered at the front of the room, I saw that some looked weird as hell, all limbs and mouths while others looked pretty normal; some even set my hormones a’rumblin’. \\n\\n“I’ll give you a moment or two to meet your buddies,” Teach bubbled and splattered. “If you’ll reach under your seats, you’ll find a number. Find whomever has the matching number.”\\n\\nI reached beneath my seat and pulled off the piece of paper tucked in the lining. Twelve. We all got up and milled around the room. \\n\\n“What do you got?” I asked a mouth with legs. It opened its mouth to reveal a three-pronged tongue wrapped around a slobber-soaked note: Thirteen. Mouthlegs walked away to greener pastures. I came across a curvy green chick with a big scaly crest on her head. She was wrapped in some kind of flimsy fabric that shimmered in pearlescent colors. Fuck yeah.\\n\\n“Twelve?” she hissed. \\n\\n“Yeah, that’s me.” I showed her the number.\\n\\n“I Thiria,” she tried to hiss in English while sitting back down. English was notoriously bitchy to speak for members of the Galactic Union. Of course, Gal-Standard was just as hard for the human mouth.\\n\\n“Mike,” I replied.\\n\\n“Pike.” Her hard lips stumbled over the word. “Nape is difficult.” \\n\\nAh yes, the classic *M* problem. A maddening motherfucker of a mess, this mass malady muddled many, or maybe most members of the GU. Few races could pronounce that damn letter. There was a good reason we all relied on the translator fog: a cloud of sentient bacteria all connected to everybodys’ nervous systems, translating their communication methods between people. Didn’t do anything for names though. Thiria reengaged her fog and sat back.\\n\\n“I think we’re going to be using the Fog a lot this year,” she said. “Thought I would try English,” she said. “Guess it didn’t work out too well. Thiria.” She held out a scaly green hand with, I noticed, three fingers and a fourth further back on the wrist. I shook it. I looked for any sign of body language but didn’t see anything, save for a forked tongue darting out of her mouth every now and then. Maybe she was sniffing the air, like a snake.\\n\\n“Mike.”\\n\\n“Now that you’ve had a chance to get together with your partners, get back together with the members of your species. You will find a piece of art. If your species is capable of music you may choose that. This art is something that represents your species.”\\n\\nI looked over at my roommates. As the first four members of the GU’s newest race, we represented all of Mankind. So naturally we should have chosen something big and classic; something something Bach, Mozart, Copeland. So of course I went to my phone and pulled up the classics: Queen, Iron Maiden, you know. Good stuff.\\n\\n\"Dammit, Kevin,\" I snapped over at Crackhead Kevin. \"Stop flirting with the Skeko chicks, we have to think about this!\"\\n\\n\"Sorry, bro,\" he turned his attention to the task at hand.\\n\\n“How ‘bout this?” I grinned as I put on Tequila, by the Champs. We all howled with laughter as the sax line came along. \\n\\n“No, no,” Crackhead Kevin grinned. The skinny bastard pulled up a video on his phone, and I momentarily reflected how great it was that the Galactic Union had connected their Galnet to the internet for uninterrupted access. “*This!*” Something, by the Butthole Surfers, came over his phone. “But a live version!” On the screen, Gibby Haynes blasted on the tuba in between the lyrics he was screaming. “Something she said to me last night! Something she said to me!”\\n\\n“Seriously, though,” my other roommate, Jim, asked, his sandy hair flopping up and down as he talked. “Maybe something that has some sort of message?” He put on Won’t Get Fooled Again, by the Who. By the time Keith Moon yelled his famous YEAH, we were all hooked.\\n\\nBrick, my third roommate, sat there, catatonic, his enormous form crammed into the tiny chair.. We waited around for Teach to call someone up.\\n\\n“Time!” the pile of tentacles said. “Who wants to go first?”\\n\\n“We will!” A pair of busty Antath girls walked to the front of the room. If I remembered my aliens correctly, the Antath were the ones who came across Earth in the first place when one of their NoSpace scouts accidentally rammed into the ISS. “I’m Gadda,” she said, her head tentacles rippling as she talked, “And this is Vida. And we have a hymn asking the Skymother to watch over us.”\\n\\n“In-a-gadda-da-vida,” Brick sang quietly as the song started. We all struggled to hold in out laughter as the beautiful strings and harmonious voices filled the room.\\n\\n“Bravo!” Teach gushed as the song finished with a flute concerto. “What a perfect piece! Why do you say it represents the Antath?”\\n\\n“Well,” Gadda, or maybe Vida said. “We are all children of the Skymother, and it helps us all when we recognise this.”\\n\\n“Wonderful! We can tell that the Antath are a deeply religious people. Now who’s next? You?” He pointed at something like a disembodied hand with centipede legs. The palm had a mouth in it. It scuttled forwards and hopped onto the podium. A painting popped up on the screen, and the hand critter pointed at various parts and gibbered and burped. Perhaps I needed my connection to the fog adjusted.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go next,\" Thiria stood up and put on a song. Something like a Gregorian chant sung by lizards filled the room. When it was done, she went into a detailed description of how the song was carefully constructed to include only sounds and tones found pleasurable by her people. \\n\\n\"And anybody who\\'s been in the galactic community for long know that her people have contributed much to the field of discomfort and pain relief!\" Squeaked Teach. \"Excellent job. Next up. Hmm… You?” He pointed up at us. “You’re humans, right? Everybody,” Teach turned back to the class, “Humans are the newest members of the Galactic Union.” And with that tidbit, he turned back to us. \\n\\nWe all walked forwards, like a murderer walking the Green Mile, and clustered around the podium.\\n\\n“I’m Mike,” I said, “and these are Jim, Brick, and Cra- Kevin. Yes! Kevin. And we picked the song ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again,’ by the Who. It’s about how those in power don’t always have your best interests at heart.”\\n\\nAnd we started the song.\\n\\nAbout halfway through, I could tell it wasn’t going well. The Antath chicks were looking at the door, for starters. Mr. Hand seemed completely disinterested. Teach stopped the song halfway through.\\n\\n“What in the galaxy was that?” Somebody asked.\\n\\n“I understand that your race is new,\" Teach said in, presumably, a soothing voice, \"and you’re trying to make your whole species look good by claiming to have developed music,” He slapped his tentacles on the ground, “but noise and music are two different things.”\\n\\nWe didn’t really hear the rest of the class go through their things; we were far too pissed off.\\n\\nAs the class let out, we tried to sneak out under the eyes of everyone, but out buddies caught up with us.\\n\\n“Pike!” Thiria called excitedly as we made for the door.\\n\\n“Gotta go, guys.” I walked over. “What’s up?”\\n\\nShe switched her fog back on. “Want to get lunch?”\\n\\nI *was* getting a little hungry. “Sure. What’s good on campus?” I followed her out the door across the grounds. \\n\\n“Not much, honestly. I know you humans sometimes eat animal flesh, but the only place that sells that is…” She pointed at a foul-smelling shack piled high with carcasses.\\n\\n“Ehhh…” I contemplated. “Let’s see what we got in the way of vegetables.”\\n\\n“Ooooh, there’s a *great* Ryellian place just off campus!” she said. “My vehicle’s just over there!”\\n\\nWe quickly ran to the skimmer and got in. “You know,” she said, “That was really mean of Teach. I mean, most of the races all have the same-sounding music, but I guess somebody’s gotta be different.”\\n\\nI watched the city go by as we drove along. Our university, and the town that cropped up around it, had been built on a habitable moon orbiting a rocky planet. The weird blobby buildings zipped by, and soon Thiria pulled into the parking lot.\\n\\n“Ever gotten Ryellian?”\\n\\nI shook my head. \\n\\n“That means ‘no,’ right? It’s simple. You take your bowl, and put the green stuff in.” She shoveled some green paste into her bowl. “Then you pick some other stuff. That brown goo is sweet, and the blue balls are salty. The red stuff… Just don’t eat the red stuff. Hold on a moment” She pulled out her communicator and started speaking in her own language. It sounded like a lot of ‘S’ and ‘Th’ sounds.\\n\\nI did as she said and scooped in my helping of paste and balls. I grabbed a utensil like a two-pronged fork and sat down. I scooped some of the concoction into my mouth, and…\\n\\n“I don’t really know what to think.” It tasted like Prime Rib topped with Caesar Salad. It wasn’t necessarily *bad*, but prime rib and caesar salad didn’t go together.\\n\\n“Don’t tell them that,” Thiria pointed at a ferretlike creature, presumably, a Ryellian. “They take their food seriously.” She took another bite. “I suppose it’s kind of like your music. Everyone hated Ryellian food at first.” She passed her bowl to a robot that took it away. “You’re going to have to convince them that your music deserves respect.”\\n\\nThat was the problem, really? Jim, Crackhead Kevin, Brick and I were all rockers. We all loved that kind of music.\\n\\n“Do you play any instruments? Oh, and don’t worry about the check. I’ll cover it.”\\n\\n“Yeah, we all-” That was a great idea. “Hell yeah! Thanks for the help!”\\n\\n“What did I do?”\\n\\n“You just gave me the best idea. We- my roommates and I; we’re gonna start a band!” I gave her a quick hug.\\n\\n“No, that isn’t what- nevermind.” Thiria said, confused. “When you finish up, I’ll show you the meeting hall.”\\n\\n“So I have to ask,” I said as we walked out. “I only know the Antath and a few others-”\\n\\n“If you’re asking what species I am; there’s a better way. Let me see your phone.” She held out a three-fingered hand.\\n\\nI pulled out the gadget and unlocked it before passing it to her. \\n\\n“There’s an app,” she explained, “That can tell you what species someone is, plus some extra information.” She passed the phone back. “Try it out!”\\n\\nI pointed the camera at her. “Perlek?” I said, and pointed the camera at one of the ferrets. “And that’s a Ryellian. And that hand thingy over there is…” The app said *Unpronounceable.* \\n\\n“Yeah… Spog’s Creature is a weird one,” Thiria said. “But the other two were right.”\\n\\nI wasn’t really paying attention at this point; I had other priorities; specifically, observing how the thing she was wearing clung to her ass. “That’s good to know,” I said. “It would have been weird asking everyone what species they are.\\n\\n“Rude, too,” she said. We’re supposed to see beyond race. But it’s just so useful for identifying people.”\\n\\nWe drove in silence for a while before Thiria spoke again. \"So what are you planning on studying?\"\\n\\n\"I was hoping to go into music education. What about you?\"\\n\\nShe looked out the window with a huff. \"I wanted to study xenoarchaeology, but my parents wouldn\\'t have their only daughter digging in the dirt for relics. They wanted me to study *music!* Um,\" she looked at me, \"No offense.\"\\n\\n\"None taken. So what did you do?\"\\n\\n\"We compromised. I\\'m now studying xeno-aural theory,\" she laughed harshly and turned back onto University Boulevard.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not enjoying it?\"\\n\\n\"Well... not really. It\\'s the same, all across the Galactic Union. Every race, the same thing. Well, you heard it. That, for all three thousand races.\"\\n\\n\"That really sucks.\" I tried to think of earth, but there was only one kind of music.\\n\\n\"Which is why I think you and the other humans are so important to this college. You are in position to give something new to, um, not just the university, but the Galactic Union.\"\\n\\nAnd with that heavy thought, I said goodbye and got out of the skimmer.\\n\\n**Now**\\n\\nSupposedly in the ultraviolet that everybody else saw things in, this place was awash with colors but to human eyes it was boring and gray. We drank our beers and peered out the window overlooking First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques campus. It looked so peaceful; just a bunch of lights spreading out below us under the planet hanging in the night sky.\\n\\n“Fuck these guys,” I groaned as I cracked open another beer.  Nothing good, just a can of Shitty Lite.\\n\\n“Seriously, guys,” said Crackhead Kevin from on the floor. “No cool music, no drinking, no parties… The Galactic Union is the worst.” I pretty much agreed with him.\\n\\n“No phthfun,” I mushed through a mouthful of beer.\\n\\n“I was seriously hoping I could party it up with some of those Skeko girls down the hall,” he mumbled. “I wanted to take a crack at that alien crack.” This last statement of his dissolved into a fit of giggling.\\n\\nI thought about our squishy-looking, banana-yellow neighbors. “Do you- do you mean crack *drugs*?” I slurred, looking at the blazed, sweaty pothead on the floor, wreathed in smoke. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he had been talking about drugs. “Or crack… crack?” Crack had to be the most useless word ever, all the meanings it had. Crack drugs, crack… crack, crack women, crack news. It was stupid. Hell, crack the noise.\\n\\n“Alien chicks, man!” Crackhead Kevin spluttered with laughter and took another hit. “Gonna be the first human to bone ‘em!”\\n\\n“Very good, Kevin, but you ever see Species? Or Skinless? Or Beyond the Flesh?”\\n\\n“The [Skymen](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b497ny/the_skymen_chapter_one/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share),” Brick continued. “[Apes](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cd7dpp/apes_chapter_1_less_a_blast_from_the_past_more_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)?\"\\n\\n“Hell, for all we know they got pussy teeth,” Jim said. \\n\\n“Did you see those- PAHAHAHAHA- Antath chicks in the orientation class? *Damn*, they had some boobs!” Crackhead Kevin continued before dissolving back into laughter.\\n\\nI sighed. The New Species College Orientation Class had been a shitshow. Ostensibly, the idea had been for members of species newly added to the Galactic Union to be paired up with members of the older races to help them get used to the GU. In practice…\\n\\n“Seriously, who thought going to an alien college was a good idea?” asked Jim. “Fuck the Galactic Union, fuck these stupid rules, and *fuck* FISTAHAT!”\\n\\nFISTAHAT was, supposedly the most prestigious music and art school in the whole damn galaxy, though it seemed they had their heads up their asses. I raised my bottle, though at this point my hand was swaying pretty bad. \"Fuck FISTAHAT!\"\\n\\n\"Hell yeah!\" Jim hollered. He and Brick clinked their bottles against mine. Crackhead Kevin raised a gaunt fist in the air.\\n\\n\"Woo!\" he said halfheartedly.\\n\\n“They have a *stupid* specific idea of what music is,” Brick mumbled. \\n\\n“You know,” I said. I searched for the vaguely beer-shaped mass in front of my eyes. Finding it, I took another drink. “My Buddy gave me an idea.”\\n\\n“Buddy?- shit,” Jim spilled my beer and leapt, sorry, flopped down to clean it up. From below the table he continued. “You mean that alien chick? The lizard girl?”\\n\\n“Oh yeah?” Brick asked before borrowing Kevin’s bowl.\\n\\n“We should start a band. I mean, Brick, you play the drums, and I took those voice lessons. Crack- *dammit*, Kevin and Jim play the guitar. We could be totally frikkin’ crack!”\\n\\n“You really think that’s a good idea?” Crackhead Kevin asked. “I mean, after today…”\\n\\n“That’s precisely why.” I liberated the bowl from Brick and took a massive hit. “You know,” I coughed, “We should save this stuff. I don’t know how long we’re gonna have to go without getting a new shipment. Same for the booze. I taste- hehehe- tasted that alien booze, it’s this nasty sugary stuff.” \\n\\n“Hmmm…” Brick got on his phone. “There’s a place we could perform. It’s in the meeting hall; every Friday they let a few bands and performers play.”\\n\\n“We talking Gimo’s?” Kevin asked. “My Buddy took me there. It’s sort of a coffee house, but different. You go there, get your drinks, and enjoy the arts. But it’s all about the arts.”\\n\\n“So it’s a coffee house.” Jim clarified.\\n\\nI got up and staggered to my room. Flipping on the lights, I grasped around for my mic and amp. “Class doesn’t start for a week, we should start practicing. Right after this nap.” I lay down on the carpet, amp in hand. At least the floor of our dorm was comfy.',\n",

We waited around for Teach to call someone up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Time!” the pile of tentacles said. “Who wants to go first?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We will!” A pair of busty Antath girls walked to the front of the room. If I remembered my aliens correctly, the Antath were the ones who came across Earth in the first place when one of their NoSpace scouts accidentally rammed into the ISS. “I’m Gadda,” she said, her head tentacles rippling as she talked, “And this is Vida. And we have a hymn asking the Skymother to watch over us.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“In-a-gadda-da-vida,” Brick sang quietly as the song started. We all struggled to hold in out laughter as the beautiful strings and harmonious voices filled the room.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Bravo!” Teach gushed as the song finished with a flute concerto. “What a perfect piece! Why do you say it represents the Antath?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well,” Gadda, or maybe Vida said. “We are all children of the Skymother, and it helps us all when we recognise this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wonderful! We can tell that the Antath are a deeply religious people. Now who’s next? You?” He pointed at something like a disembodied hand with centipede legs. The palm had a mouth in it. It scuttled forwards and hopped onto the podium. A painting popped up on the screen, and the hand critter pointed at various parts and gibbered and burped. Perhaps I needed my connection to the fog adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll go next,&amp;quot; Thiria stood up and put on a song. Something like a Gregorian chant sung by lizards filled the room. When it was done, she went into a detailed description of how the song was carefully constructed to include only sounds and tones found pleasurable by her people. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And anybody who&amp;#39;s been in the galactic community for long know that her people have contributed much to the field of discomfort and pain relief!&amp;quot; Squeaked Teach. &amp;quot;Excellent job. Next up. Hmm… You?” He pointed up at us. “You’re humans, right? Everybody,” Teach turned back to the class, “Humans are the newest members of the Galactic Union.” And with that tidbit, he turned back to us. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We all walked forwards, like a murderer walking the Green Mile, and clustered around the podium.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike,” I said, “and these are Jim, Brick, and Cra- Kevin. Yes! Kevin. And we picked the song ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again,’ by the Who. It’s about how those in power don’t always have your best interests at heart.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And we started the song.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;About halfway through, I could tell it wasn’t going well. The Antath chicks were looking at the door, for starters. Mr. Hand seemed completely disinterested. Teach stopped the song halfway through.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What in the galaxy was that?” Somebody asked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I understand that your race is new,&amp;quot; Teach said in, presumably, a soothing voice, &amp;quot;and you’re trying to make your whole species look good by claiming to have developed music,” He slapped his tentacles on the ground, “but noise and music are two different things.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We didn’t really hear the rest of the class go through their things; we were far too pissed off.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the class let out, we tried to sneak out under the eyes of everyone, but out buddies caught up with us.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Pike!” Thiria called excitedly as we made for the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Gotta go, guys.” I walked over. “What’s up?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She switched her fog back on. “Want to get lunch?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; getting a little hungry. “Sure. What’s good on campus?” I followed her out the door across the grounds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Not much, honestly. I know you humans sometimes eat animal flesh, but the only place that sells that is…” She pointed at a foul-smelling shack piled high with carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ehhh…” I contemplated. “Let’s see what we got in the way of vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ooooh, there’s a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; Ryellian place just off campus!” she said. “My vehicle’s just over there!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We quickly ran to the skimmer and got in. “You know,” she said, “That was really mean of Teach. I mean, most of the races all have the same-sounding music, but I guess somebody’s gotta be different.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I watched the city go by as we drove along. Our university, and the town that cropped up around it, had been built on a habitable moon orbiting a rocky planet. The weird blobby buildings zipped by, and soon Thiria pulled into the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ever gotten Ryellian?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That means ‘no,’ right? It’s simple. You take your bowl, and put the green stuff in.” She shoveled some green paste into her bowl. “Then you pick some other stuff. That brown goo is sweet, and the blue balls are salty. The red stuff… Just don’t eat the red stuff. Hold on a moment” She pulled out her communicator and started speaking in her own language. It sounded like a lot of ‘S’ and ‘Th’ sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did as she said and scooped in my helping of paste and balls. I grabbed a utensil like a two-pronged fork and sat down. I scooped some of the concoction into my mouth, and…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really know what to think.” It tasted like Prime Rib topped with Caesar Salad. It wasn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but prime rib and caesar salad didn’t go together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t tell them that,” Thiria pointed at a ferretlike creature, presumably, a Ryellian. “They take their food seriously.” She took another bite. “I suppose it’s kind of like your music. Everyone hated Ryellian food at first.” She passed her bowl to a robot that took it away. “You’re going to have to convince them that your music deserves respect.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was the problem, really? Jim, Crackhead Kevin, Brick and I were all rockers. We all loved that kind of music.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Do you play any instruments? Oh, and don’t worry about the check. I’ll cover it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, we all-” That was a great idea. “Hell yeah! Thanks for the help!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What did I do?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You just gave me the best idea. We- my roommates and I; we’re gonna start a band!” I gave her a quick hug.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, that isn’t what- nevermind.” Thiria said, confused. “When you finish up, I’ll show you the meeting hall.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So I have to ask,” I said as we walked out. “I only know the Antath and a few others-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you’re asking what species I am; there’s a better way. Let me see your phone.” She held out a three-fingered hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out the gadget and unlocked it before passing it to her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s an app,” she explained, “That can tell you what species someone is, plus some extra information.” She passed the phone back. “Try it out!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed the camera at her. “Perlek?” I said, and pointed the camera at one of the ferrets. “And that’s a Ryellian. And that hand thingy over there is…” The app said &lt;em&gt;Unpronounceable.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… Spog’s Creature is a weird one,” Thiria said. “But the other two were right.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t really paying attention at this point; I had other priorities; specifically, observing how the thing she was wearing clung to her ass. “That’s good to know,” I said. “It would have been weird asking everyone what species they are.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Rude, too,” she said. We’re supposed to see beyond race. But it’s just so useful for identifying people.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We drove in silence for a while before Thiria spoke again. &amp;quot;So what are you planning on studying?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was hoping to go into music education. What about you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked out the window with a huff. &amp;quot;I wanted to study xenoarchaeology, but my parents wouldn&amp;#39;t have their only daughter digging in the dirt for relics. They wanted me to study &lt;em&gt;music!&lt;/em&gt; Um,&amp;quot; she looked at me, &amp;quot;No offense.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;None taken. So what did you do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We compromised. I&amp;#39;m now studying xeno-aural theory,&amp;quot; she laughed harshly and turned back onto University Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not enjoying it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well... not really. It&amp;#39;s the same, all across the Galactic Union. Every race, the same thing. Well, you heard it. That, for all three thousand races.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That really sucks.&amp;quot; I tried to think of earth, but there was only one kind of music.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Which is why I think you and the other humans are so important to this college. You are in position to give something new to, um, not just the university, but the Galactic Union.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And with that heavy thought, I said goodbye and got out of the skimmer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Supposedly in the ultraviolet that everybody else saw things in, this place was awash with colors but to human eyes it was boring and gray. We drank our beers and peered out the window overlooking First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques campus. It looked so peaceful; just a bunch of lights spreading out below us under the planet hanging in the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fuck these guys,” I groaned as I cracked open another beer.  Nothing good, just a can of Shitty Lite.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, guys,” said Crackhead Kevin from on the floor. “No cool music, no drinking, no parties… The Galactic Union is the worst.” I pretty much agreed with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No phthfun,” I mushed through a mouthful of beer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I was seriously hoping I could party it up with some of those Skeko girls down the hall,” he mumbled. “I wanted to take a crack at that alien crack.” This last statement of his dissolved into a fit of giggling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about our squishy-looking, banana-yellow neighbors. “Do you- do you mean crack &lt;em&gt;drugs&lt;/em&gt;?” I slurred, looking at the blazed, sweaty pothead on the floor, wreathed in smoke. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he had been talking about drugs. “Or crack… crack?” Crack had to be the most useless word ever, all the meanings it had. Crack drugs, crack… crack, crack women, crack news. It was stupid. Hell, crack the noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Alien chicks, man!” Crackhead Kevin spluttered with laughter and took another hit. “Gonna be the first human to bone ‘em!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Very good, Kevin, but you ever see Species? Or Skinless? Or Beyond the Flesh?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b497ny/the_skymen_chapter_one/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Skymen&lt;/a&gt;,” Brick continued. “&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cd7dpp/apes_chapter_1_less_a_blast_from_the_past_more_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Apes&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hell, for all we know they got pussy teeth,” Jim said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Did you see those- PAHAHAHAHA- Antath chicks in the orientation class? &lt;em&gt;Damn&lt;/em&gt;, they had some boobs!” Crackhead Kevin continued before dissolving back into laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed. The New Species College Orientation Class had been a shitshow. Ostensibly, the idea had been for members of species newly added to the Galactic Union to be paired up with members of the older races to help them get used to the GU. In practice…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, who thought going to an alien college was a good idea?” asked Jim. “Fuck the Galactic Union, fuck these stupid rules, and &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; FISTAHAT!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;FISTAHAT was, supposedly the most prestigious music and art school in the whole damn galaxy, though it seemed they had their heads up their asses. I raised my bottle, though at this point my hand was swaying pretty bad. &amp;quot;Fuck FISTAHAT!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hell yeah!&amp;quot; Jim hollered. He and Brick clinked their bottles against mine. Crackhead Kevin raised a gaunt fist in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woo!&amp;quot; he said halfheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They have a &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; specific idea of what music is,” Brick mumbled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You know,” I said. I searched for the vaguely beer-shaped mass in front of my eyes. Finding it, I took another drink. “My Buddy gave me an idea.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy?- shit,” Jim spilled my beer and leapt, sorry, flopped down to clean it up. From below the table he continued. “You mean that alien chick? The lizard girl?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah?” Brick asked before borrowing Kevin’s bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We should start a band. I mean, Brick, you play the drums, and I took those voice lessons. Crack- &lt;em&gt;dammit&lt;/em&gt;, Kevin and Jim play the guitar. We could be totally frikkin’ crack!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You really think that’s a good idea?” Crackhead Kevin asked. “I mean, after today…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s precisely why.” I liberated the bowl from Brick and took a massive hit. “You know,” I coughed, “We should save this stuff. I don’t know how long we’re gonna have to go without getting a new shipment. Same for the booze. I taste- hehehe- tasted that alien booze, it’s this nasty sugary stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmmm…” Brick got on his phone. “There’s a place we could perform. It’s in the meeting hall; every Friday they let a few bands and performers play.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We talking Gimo’s?” Kevin asked. “My Buddy took me there. It’s sort of a coffee house, but different. You go there, get your drinks, and enjoy the arts. But it’s all about the arts.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a coffee house.” Jim clarified.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and staggered to my room. Flipping on the lights, I grasped around for my mic and amp. “Class doesn’t start for a week, we should start practicing. Right after this nap.” I lay down on the carpet, amp in hand. At least the floor of our dorm was comfy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': ' (*I need the cross-crank again*.) Andra held out a hand expectantly and was pleased to felt the familiar handle land in her palm without hesitation. (Thanks.\\n\\n(*This is surprisingly calming*,) Cygnus replied as he worked busily on a panel nearby. He was between meetings, and had taken to coming down to help her with her ship whenever he had some free time. Andra still hadn’t figured out why, and he still hadn’t deigned to answer when she asked. (*Is that why you’re always down here*?)\\n\\nThey were far enough away from each other that they would have had to yell. Fortunately, Cygnus was more than powerful enough to hold a mental conversation link between them, even when they were both focused on separate, intricate, tasks.\\n\\n(*I’m always down here because I would really rather not be noticed by anyone important*,) Andra told him dryly, and heard him snort from the other side of the ship. (*Besides you, anyway. Why do you think I haven’t told anyone I saw your vision?*)\\n\\n(*I assumed it spooked you,*) Cygnus said, not exactly hesitant, but aware of her discomfort about the matter. They hadn’t discussed the vision at all. (*High-level precognition is rare, and mine can be… overwhelming, even when the subject isn’t as distressing as this was. Also, I need the crank back unless you want me to risk ripping this panel off entirely*.)\\n\\nHis telekinesis was as powerful as his other gifts, but that much power often had control limitations.\\xa0\\n\\nHe could probably crack a moon in half, if he was willing to burn himself out to do it. But lift a teacup, or screw in a bolt? Completely beyond his abilities.\\n\\nNot for the first time, Andra was glad that her own telekinesis was so minor. She might not be able to do the big stuff, but the little stuff was usually more useful.\\n\\nShe wrenched three more bolts into place and floated the crank back to him with a thought. He caught it easily and began unscrewing the panel with quick pulls. (*I’ll need you here in a moment. This is more complicated than I can learn and do at the same time.*)\\n\\n(*One minute*.)\\n\\nAndra finished with her bolts and slid out from under the ship. Her coveralls were spattered with oil and space dust, and she wiped off her hands before she joined Cygnus at the panel. A large orb of woven wires, insulation, papers, and buts of plastic dominated most of the interior “Crap. That looks like a chimma nest.”\\n\\nIt was jarring to go from mental speech to verbal, but the connection still buzzed between them, carrying images and concepts that made the words come easier.\\n\\n“Chimmas?” He kept his hands well away from the woven next of wires and insulation even as Andra eyed it, mind flavored heavily with irritation at the previous owner of the ship. “What are chimmas?”\\n\\n“Little, annoying,” Andra summed up, grumbling even as she dug in her tool chest for the tough syn-leather gloves she kept handy. “Can bite through just about anything. They’d be cute, if they didn’t destroy wiring so fast.”\\n\\nShe grabbed a bucket and set it under the nest. Slime poured out as she began scraping the nest out of the wiring cavity. Tiny glowing rodents scattered in every direction and she caught as many as she could before they could escape.\\xa0\\n\\nCygnus was appalled, and a little disgusted as slime and wiring drizzled off her gloves and into the bucket. “This thing is a death trap. How is *this* the ship your Edge Leader chose to get here?”\\n\\n“I’m one of the best pilots we have,” Andra said, and cursed when one of the chimmas decided to go on the attack. She batted it into the bucket with more force than was strictly necessary, and it chittered at her furiously with the rest of its’ kind. “And my ship might be beat up, but it’s *mine*, free and clear.”\\n\\n“You *paid* for this flying death trap?”\\xa0\\n\\nCygnus was growing significantly more horrified by the moment. Andra flicked a chimma at him and had the distinct pleasure of watching him scramble to catch it, before he managed to scrape it off him and into the bucket with the others.\\n\\n“Yes, I paid for it,” Andra told him, and sighed when she got the last of the nest out of the wiring. “I saved for months to buy this ship. Don’t knock it. Close that up, yeah?”\\n\\n“You know I’m the most powerful Psion on Vega Base, right?” Cygnus said darkly, but he tapped the bucket lid down when she pointed at it. “I could explode your head with a thought.”\\n\\n“If you’re gonna, you’re gonna,” Andra told him and eyed the panel considering, before reaching in with her limited telekinesis. One by one, she diverted the almost-microscopic converters from the damaged wiring until the panel lit up a healthy green. When she turned around, he was staring at her, with an odd color to his mental ‘presence’ in her head. “What?”\\n\\n“What you just did,” he said, and leaned in close to the panel to examine the converters. “You said you were tested, yes?”\\n\\n“Precog and ‘path,” Andra confirmed, and decided that she could work and figure him out at the same time. With most of the chimmas contained, it was safe to close up. “Why? Cyg, you’re being weird.”\\n\\n“Were you tested on telekinesis too?”\\xa0\\n\\nHe was watching her closely, and Andra finally turned to give him her full attention. “No, I’ve never been able to lift more than a few pounds.”\\n\\n“It’s not all about weight,” Cygnus said slowly, and waved a hand. Her whole ship lifted off the ground weightlessly. “Who tested you?”\\n\\n“Lyr Kort, on Asteroid Base forty-two,” Andra said dubiously. “He tested all the Edge kids who showed any sign of Psi abilities. He got me into pilot training.”\\n\\n“He’s a hack,” Cygnus muttered, and sighed when he felt her confusion. Among his other abilities was low-grade Empathy, for all that he rarely used it. “Andra, micro-manipulation takes *more* power than macro-manipulation. It’s much harder to move very small things than it is to move big ones.”\\n\\n“It’s not a big deal,” she defended herself uncomfortably, and pulled off her gloves. “I mean, it’s useful, but-“\\n\\n“You don’t understand,” Cygnus said. Excitement tugged at the edges of his mind. “Compatible minds always have paired abilities, or they run the risk of burning each other out when they go into syzygy. I have *macro* telekinesis in spades, but my micro telekinesis is nonexistent. I explode things, usually. But you- if you’re doing electro-mechanical adjustments with your micro, your abilities are off the charts.”\\n\\n“You’ve got to be kidding,” Andra said, and leaned against her tool chest to consider what he was saying more seriously. On one hand, he was the leader of the psionic mercenary group, and probably knew what he was talking about. On the other… “What about my ‘path abilities? Still crap.”\\n\\n“You’re probably a receiver, not a projector,” Cygnus said thoughtfully, although he still had interesting bursts of excitement going off in his mind. Andra thought he was probably blowing things out of proportion a little. “Easy enough to test, when Ursa goes back to the capital. Now that I know you’re out here, I can reach for you, and if you can hear me, that will prove it.”\\n\\n“I’ve never heard of being a ‘receiving telepath’,” Andra told him dubiously, although her education as an Asteroid-Base orphan and grease monkey left plenty of education to be desired. There was only so much she could learn on her own in her spare time. “I can tell you for sure that my precog isn’t as strong as yours.”\\n\\n“Different doesn’t mean weaker,” Cygnus muttered, and scanned through his memory, fitting puzzle pieces together at light speed. “I bet yours is more reliable than mine, even if you don’t see as far ahead. You saw what mine looks like, and didn’t lose yourself in it. Point of fact, you pulled me *out.”*\\n\\n“Is that odd?” She wouldn’t know. Almost no one in the Edge Revolution had serious precog. They tended to go insane.\\n\\nThat might explain some of Cygnus being so weird.\\xa0\\n\\n“I heard that,” he told her, but he was too pleased with himself and her to care. “I’ve never been in syzygy with anyone during a precognitive incident.”\\n\\n“It sounds so *fancy* when you say it like that.”\\n\\n“Just because I’m using the correct language-“\\n\\nWhatever else he was going to say froze on his tongue as that same, terrible, yawning pit opened in his mind.\\n\\nAndra only had a moment to anchor herself in her own *self* before Cygnus was falling away into the vision, gasping for breath and already starting to seize. Blackness devoured the hanger port and the ship until there was nothing but stars and open space around them.\\n\\nA ship, oddly smooth and laden with weapons loomed over a glowing blue planet.\\n\\nA single rocket, tiny, compared to the ship, left a comet trail as it fired down, and vanished through the clouds far below, and billowed a perfect, terrifying circle though the soft white.\\n\\nThere was no sound, but Andra wished there was. The silence was almost worse as a shockwave rippled outward from the planet and hit them like a drum inside their chests. The force of it almost shook her loose, but Andra held onto her anchor and Cygnus determinedly, unwilling to lose either of them in the vision.\\n\\nFor a long moment after the shockwave faded, everything was absolutely still.\\n\\nAnd then deep, fire-lined cracks appeared blazing red-orange against all that blue.\\n\\nSpouts of molten stone shot into space in every direction, creating vast pillars as they hit the cold of space, but the eruption on the surface continued, viciously exploding continent after continent away into the black, still glowing with the heat of a fiery planet core.\\n\\nLimed by the death of a planet, something on the massive ship *noticed* them, and suddenly Andra was drowning in raw, directed *hatred*.\\n\\n(Hold on,) Cygnus whispered in their mind, and gathered himself. Andra showed him the anchor she held them by, and felt him understand.\\xa0\\n\\nWith a hard push against the vision, they were out, breathing hard on the greasy floor of the hanger.\\n\\n“They’re coming for us,” Cygnus rasped, and struggled to his feet, before helping Andra to hers. “We have to tell command.”\\n\\n“So much for staying under the radar,” Andra said, and steeled herself before she nodded firmly. “Okay. Let’s go.”\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\nIf you like this and want more, check out my masterlist at r/LeeHadanWrites',\n",

Andra held out a hand expectantly and was pleased to felt the familiar handle land in her palm without hesitation. (Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This is surprisingly calming&lt;/em&gt;,) Cygnus replied as he worked busily on a panel nearby. He was between meetings, and had taken to coming down to help her with her ship whenever he had some free time. Andra still hadn’t figured out why, and he still hadn’t deigned to answer when she asked. (&lt;em&gt;Is that why you’re always down here&lt;/em&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were far enough away from each other that they would have had to yell. Fortunately, Cygnus was more than powerful enough to hold a mental conversation link between them, even when they were both focused on separate, intricate, tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I’m always down here because I would really rather not be noticed by anyone important&lt;/em&gt;,) Andra told him dryly, and heard him snort from the other side of the ship. (&lt;em&gt;Besides you, anyway. Why do you think I haven’t told anyone I saw your vision?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I assumed it spooked you,&lt;/em&gt;) Cygnus said, not exactly hesitant, but aware of her discomfort about the matter. They hadn’t discussed the vision at all. (&lt;em&gt;High-level precognition is rare, and mine can be… overwhelming, even when the subject isn’t as distressing as this was. Also, I need the crank back unless you want me to risk ripping this panel off entirely&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His telekinesis was as powerful as his other gifts, but that much power often had control limitations.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He could probably crack a moon in half, if he was willing to burn himself out to do it. But lift a teacup, or screw in a bolt? Completely beyond his abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not for the first time, Andra was glad that her own telekinesis was so minor. She might not be able to do the big stuff, but the little stuff was usually more useful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She wrenched three more bolts into place and floated the crank back to him with a thought. He caught it easily and began unscrewing the panel with quick pulls. (&lt;em&gt;I’ll need you here in a moment. This is more complicated than I can learn and do at the same time.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;One minute&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Andra finished with her bolts and slid out from under the ship. Her coveralls were spattered with oil and space dust, and she wiped off her hands before she joined Cygnus at the panel. A large orb of woven wires, insulation, papers, and buts of plastic dominated most of the interior “Crap. That looks like a chimma nest.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was jarring to go from mental speech to verbal, but the connection still buzzed between them, carrying images and concepts that made the words come easier.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Chimmas?” He kept his hands well away from the woven next of wires and insulation even as Andra eyed it, mind flavored heavily with irritation at the previous owner of the ship. “What are chimmas?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Little, annoying,” Andra summed up, grumbling even as she dug in her tool chest for the tough syn-leather gloves she kept handy. “Can bite through just about anything. They’d be cute, if they didn’t destroy wiring so fast.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed a bucket and set it under the nest. Slime poured out as she began scraping the nest out of the wiring cavity. Tiny glowing rodents scattered in every direction and she caught as many as she could before they could escape.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cygnus was appalled, and a little disgusted as slime and wiring drizzled off her gloves and into the bucket. “This thing is a death trap. How is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; the ship your Edge Leader chose to get here?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m one of the best pilots we have,” Andra said, and cursed when one of the chimmas decided to go on the attack. She batted it into the bucket with more force than was strictly necessary, and it chittered at her furiously with the rest of its’ kind. “And my ship might be beat up, but it’s &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, free and clear.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; for this flying death trap?”\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cygnus was growing significantly more horrified by the moment. Andra flicked a chimma at him and had the distinct pleasure of watching him scramble to catch it, before he managed to scrape it off him and into the bucket with the others.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I paid for it,” Andra told him, and sighed when she got the last of the nest out of the wiring. “I saved for months to buy this ship. Don’t knock it. Close that up, yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You know I’m the most powerful Psion on Vega Base, right?” Cygnus said darkly, but he tapped the bucket lid down when she pointed at it. “I could explode your head with a thought.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you’re gonna, you’re gonna,” Andra told him and eyed the panel considering, before reaching in with her limited telekinesis. One by one, she diverted the almost-microscopic converters from the damaged wiring until the panel lit up a healthy green. When she turned around, he was staring at her, with an odd color to his mental ‘presence’ in her head. “What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What you just did,” he said, and leaned in close to the panel to examine the converters. “You said you were tested, yes?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Precog and ‘path,” Andra confirmed, and decided that she could work and figure him out at the same time. With most of the chimmas contained, it was safe to close up. “Why? Cyg, you’re being weird.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Were you tested on telekinesis too?”\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was watching her closely, and Andra finally turned to give him her full attention. “No, I’ve never been able to lift more than a few pounds.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s not all about weight,” Cygnus said slowly, and waved a hand. Her whole ship lifted off the ground weightlessly. “Who tested you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Lyr Kort, on Asteroid Base forty-two,” Andra said dubiously. “He tested all the Edge kids who showed any sign of Psi abilities. He got me into pilot training.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He’s a hack,” Cygnus muttered, and sighed when he felt her confusion. Among his other abilities was low-grade Empathy, for all that he rarely used it. “Andra, micro-manipulation takes &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; power than macro-manipulation. It’s much harder to move very small things than it is to move big ones.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a big deal,” she defended herself uncomfortably, and pulled off her gloves. “I mean, it’s useful, but-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t understand,” Cygnus said. Excitement tugged at the edges of his mind. “Compatible minds always have paired abilities, or they run the risk of burning each other out when they go into syzygy. I have &lt;em&gt;macro&lt;/em&gt; telekinesis in spades, but my micro telekinesis is nonexistent. I explode things, usually. But you- if you’re doing electro-mechanical adjustments with your micro, your abilities are off the charts.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to be kidding,” Andra said, and leaned against her tool chest to consider what he was saying more seriously. On one hand, he was the leader of the psionic mercenary group, and probably knew what he was talking about. On the other… “What about my ‘path abilities? Still crap.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re probably a receiver, not a projector,” Cygnus said thoughtfully, although he still had interesting bursts of excitement going off in his mind. Andra thought he was probably blowing things out of proportion a little. “Easy enough to test, when Ursa goes back to the capital. Now that I know you’re out here, I can reach for you, and if you can hear me, that will prove it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never heard of being a ‘receiving telepath’,” Andra told him dubiously, although her education as an Asteroid-Base orphan and grease monkey left plenty of education to be desired. There was only so much she could learn on her own in her spare time. “I can tell you for sure that my precog isn’t as strong as yours.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Different doesn’t mean weaker,” Cygnus muttered, and scanned through his memory, fitting puzzle pieces together at light speed. “I bet yours is more reliable than mine, even if you don’t see as far ahead. You saw what mine looks like, and didn’t lose yourself in it. Point of fact, you pulled me &lt;em&gt;out.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that odd?” She wouldn’t know.

The dragon...my dragon? our dragon, now, ours as in our little group, ours as in all of humanity...she\\'s folded her wings and she stands there waiting with that strange maybe-bottomless patience of hers. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve finally found what I\\'ve been looking for, Kether. What my parents were looking for, all those years. What *dad* was looking for.\"\\n\\nHe winces and I know it\\'s unfair, that I\\'ve twisted a knife of special unkindness, but it\\'s the only one I can find right now and it\\'s a delicate moment, I don\\'t feel I should go into it unarmed. Kether and I aren\\'t blood, but he and my father were good as brothers. Better than most, really. I step forward and hold out my hand. \"Listen,\" I say, \"I know the risks, who better? Mom and Dad taught me everything they could, and you know damn well just how much that was. Yeah, sure, he\\'s serious danger. But it\\'s also serious *hope*, Kether, the first we\\'ve had in a long, long time. Since before I was born, probably, right?\"\\n\\nKether takes in a deep breath, and lets it out in slow irregular huffs. He doesn\\'t look at the dragon, though of course she\\'s right there in the peripheral of his sight, like he\\'s sure seeing her directly would be too much for his decision-making faculties. And maybe it would. He looks at my hand, instead, then walks forward and takes it in his own, huge almost-white palm and fingers just about engulfing my smaller near-black ones.  And he pulls me in for a quick hug, slapping me roughly on the back the way he always does, and as usual the smell and feel of him is comforting and a little sad, old memories of being held when I was smaller and Dad\\'s death was still fresh.\\n\\nI slap his broad back in return and step back, then step back again so I can look him in the eye without having to crane my neck too much. I\\'m not an especially short woman, about average, but he\\'s a giant of a man, and even though some of his bulk no longer comes from just muscle most of the muscle is still there. Dad says—used to say—that he\\'d seen Kether do some exceptional things, the kind of exceptional he never wanted to see again, back when they were more hotheaded and foolish and willing to take the fight directly to the fey.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t named her yet.\" I don\\'t know why these are the first words to come to my mind and escape my lips, but they are and I glance over at her, but she\\'s still waiting, patient as living polished stone.\\n\\n\"She?\" Kether says, but he\\'s interrupted by a little girl, creeping out along the walls to stand just next to the dragon, small brown hand outstretched, caution warring curiosity in her dirty, delicate features.\\n\\n\"Can I touch her?\" the girl asks. I don\\'t know her name, I\\'m away from home too frequently and for too long to keep track of all the children who live here, I couldn\\'t really even tell you how many of them there are, I think there are something like three hundred of us in total?\\n\\n\"Sure,\" I say, the decision made in an instant and I\\'m not entirely sure just how momentous it might be, it feels like it is even though it\\'s just one child touching an ancient machine with no reason at all to harm her and why should that matter so much?\\n\\nBut it does, and I know it. We all know it, looking on.\\n\\n*Child is curious? Physical contact is no problem will do no harm to DRAGON unit, DRAGON unit does not harm human children by intention, this is absolute baseline instruction.*\\n\\nDragon does not harm *human* children. That gives me a small shudder. Maybe the part about intention should too, but I know enough about war to know that it doesn\\'t bound its horrors, the best of intentions can lead to the greatest of horrors and there\\'s nothing to do but go on, and maybe learn if you\\'re really lucky. So, okay, but...*human* children? We\\'re going to have to have a talk, she and I, after she\\'s named, after she\\'s introduced. \\n\\nThe little girl is still looking back and forth between me and the dragon, maybe because Kether has stepped forward as though ready to intervene. I give her a little nod.\\n\\nA small hand rests gently on the scintillating skin of a graceful neck. \"She\\'s so pretty,\" the girl whispers, then jumps back. \"She talked to me! In my head!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say, and my voice seems like it\\'s coming from somewhere far away, from someone else maybe. \"That\\'s how she talks, usually.\"\\n\\n**Apologies,** comes the strange metallic voice for the second time. **DRAGON unit did not mean to startle. Child is welcome.**\\n\\nKether is staring, now, eyes wide, one of the few times I\\'ve ever seen him at a loss what to say or do. \"It speaks telepathically? Like an Elf Mage-Commander to her troops?\"\\n\\n\"She,\" I correct him, without even thinking about it. \"Yes. I was a little surprised to hear her say something out loud just now.\"\\n\\n**Audible sound not difficult. Vibrations in air at correct frequencies. Linguistic corrections more difficult. Have observed Operator Kella word-patterns, reconstructing local dialect with temporal drift.**\\n\\nKether laughs, soft and low. \"So you\\'re \\'Operator Kella\\' now? Does she see you as her owner, then?\"\\n\\nThe dragon ruffles her unfeathered wings, showing tiny scales that rise and smooth out on their surface instead. **Ownership is difficult concept, originally military weapon, military defunct Butlerian Empire fallen, Operator Kella recognized for initiative in seeking out DRAGON unit. Knowledge of old Empire plus DRAGON unit very high for new Dark Age. DRAGON unit is satisfied with arrangement does not wish to revise.**\\n\\nI\\'m touched, honestly, absurdly so, and I think this is the first time I\\'ve heard her actually express any sort of emotion or desire of her own, at least directly like that. \"Satisfied with arrangement.\" I suppose there are more eloquent ways to express that kind of sentiment—but I\\'ll take it just the same.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" I say, loudly enough for everyone listening to hear, and I\\'m suddenly aware of the wider scope to this little drama, all the other faces gathered round, watching, remembering.\\n\\n*This is a legend,* I think, *someday parents will tell this story to their children, even if we fail people will remember this. I\\'m not sure if that makes me feel motivated or terrified. Probably plenty of both.*\\n\\n*Operator Kella will do well,* she sends back, and I suppose I should have realized she would catch all of that, I\\'m not exactly in a guarded moment. I send another thanks to her, silently this time, because I\\'ve also got to say something now, it\\'s expected, it\\'s right for the moment, and I\\'m not ready but\\n\\n*readiness is nice but now has the necessity*\\n\\nand I breathe in deep and let my gaze scan the little crowd, gathering larger every moment.\\n\\n\"I\\'m no good at speeches, I\\'m just a scavver really,\" I say. \"Speeches were Dad\\'s thing. Some of you knew him, a few others knew the kind of thing he and Mom were always looking for. Well, now I\\'ve found it. Found *her*. She still needs a name, but like I told Kether just a few moments ago, she\\'s the best hope we\\'ve had in a long, long time. We need to meet and talk about going forward. This place is fine for now but soon enough she\\'ll outgrow it, and we won\\'t evade fey notice for too long.\"\\n\\nI close my eyes, knowing I shouldn\\'t, I should project confidence in front of this crowd, this should be a legendary speech for a legendary beginning, but humanity gets what it gets, it gets me, I\\'ll just do my best and that\\'s all they can ask, all I can ask of myself.\\n\\n*That is all but best can improve, all can be added to, Operator Kella will have help grow with DRAGON unit not larger but other ways.*\\n\\nGods damn it all I\\'m sending again, but that\\'s alright, I send warmth back to her because that\\'s what the words give me and I don\\'t have time to process them right now even though they\\'re what I needed and I reach out, set my hand gently on the base of her neck, feeling what the little girl felt, surprisingly warm, dry and smooth-scaled.\\n\\nEveryone is still looking at me, not seeming to mind the pause. The moment overspills with possibility and I reach for one.

The dragon...my dragon? our dragon, now, ours as in our little group, ours as in all of humanity...she&amp;#39;s folded her wings and she stands there waiting with that strange maybe-bottomless patience of hers. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve finally found what I&amp;#39;ve been looking for, Kether. What my parents were looking for, all those years. What &lt;em&gt;dad&lt;/em&gt; was looking for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He winces and I know it&amp;#39;s unfair, that I&amp;#39;ve twisted a knife of special unkindness, but it&amp;#39;s the only one I can find right now and it&amp;#39;s a delicate moment, I don&amp;#39;t feel I should go into it unarmed. Kether and I aren&amp;#39;t blood, but he and my father were good as brothers. Better than most, really. I step forward and hold out my hand. &amp;quot;Listen,&amp;quot; I say, &amp;quot;I know the risks, who better? Mom and Dad taught me everything they could, and you know damn well just how much that was. Yeah, sure, he&amp;#39;s serious danger. But it&amp;#39;s also serious &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;, Kether, the first we&amp;#39;ve had in a long, long time. Since before I was born, probably, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether takes in a deep breath, and lets it out in slow irregular huffs. He doesn&amp;#39;t look at the dragon, though of course she&amp;#39;s right there in the peripheral of his sight, like he&amp;#39;s sure seeing her directly would be too much for his decision-making faculties. And maybe it would. He looks at my hand, instead, then walks forward and takes it in his own, huge almost-white palm and fingers just about engulfing my smaller near-black ones.  And he pulls me in for a quick hug, slapping me roughly on the back the way he always does, and as usual the smell and feel of him is comforting and a little sad, old memories of being held when I was smaller and Dad&amp;#39;s death was still fresh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slap his broad back in return and step back, then step back again so I can look him in the eye without having to crane my neck too much. I&amp;#39;m not an especially short woman, about average, but he&amp;#39;s a giant of a man, and even though some of his bulk no longer comes from just muscle most of the muscle is still there. Dad says—used to say—that he&amp;#39;d seen Kether do some exceptional things, the kind of exceptional he never wanted to see again, back when they were more hotheaded and foolish and willing to take the fight directly to the fey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t named her yet.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know why these are the first words to come to my mind and escape my lips, but they are and I glance over at her, but she&amp;#39;s still waiting, patient as living polished stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She?&amp;quot; Kether says, but he&amp;#39;s interrupted by a little girl, creeping out along the walls to stand just next to the dragon, small brown hand outstretched, caution warring curiosity in her dirty, delicate features.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I touch her?&amp;quot; the girl asks. I don&amp;#39;t know her name, I&amp;#39;m away from home too frequently and for too long to keep track of all the children who live here, I couldn&amp;#39;t really even tell you how many of them there are, I think there are something like three hundred of us in total?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure,&amp;quot; I say, the decision made in an instant and I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure just how momentous it might be, it feels like it is even though it&amp;#39;s just one child touching an ancient machine with no reason at all to harm her and why should that matter so much?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But it does, and I know it. We all know it, looking on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Child is curious? Physical contact is no problem will do no harm to DRAGON unit, DRAGON unit does not harm human children by intention, this is absolute baseline instruction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragon does not harm &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; children. That gives me a small shudder. Maybe the part about intention should too, but I know enough about war to know that it doesn&amp;#39;t bound its horrors, the best of intentions can lead to the greatest of horrors and there&amp;#39;s nothing to do but go on, and maybe learn if you&amp;#39;re really lucky. So, okay, but...&lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; children? We&amp;#39;re going to have to have a talk, she and I, after she&amp;#39;s named, after she&amp;#39;s introduced. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl is still looking back and forth between me and the dragon, maybe because Kether has stepped forward as though ready to intervene. I give her a little nod.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A small hand rests gently on the scintillating skin of a graceful neck. &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s so pretty,&amp;quot; the girl whispers, then jumps back. &amp;quot;She talked to me! In my head!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I say, and my voice seems like it&amp;#39;s coming from somewhere far away, from someone else maybe. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s how she talks, usually.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apologies,&lt;/strong&gt; comes the strange metallic voice for the second time. &lt;strong&gt;DRAGON unit did not mean to startle. Child is welcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether is staring, now, eyes wide, one of the few times I&amp;#39;ve ever seen him at a loss what to say or do. &amp;quot;It speaks telepathically? Like an Elf Mage-Commander to her troops?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She,&amp;quot; I correct him, without even thinking about it. &amp;quot;Yes. I was a little surprised to hear her say something out loud just now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audible sound not difficult. Vibrations in air at correct frequencies. Linguistic corrections more difficult. Have observed Operator Kella word-patterns, reconstructing local dialect with temporal drift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether laughs, soft and low. &amp;quot;So you&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;Operator Kella&amp;#39; now? Does she see you as her owner, then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dragon ruffles her unfeathered wings, showing tiny scales that rise and smooth out on their surface instead. &lt;strong&gt;Ownership is difficult concept, originally military weapon, military defunct Butlerian Empire fallen, Operator Kella recognized for initiative in seeking out DRAGON unit. Knowledge of old Empire plus DRAGON unit very high for new Dark Age. DRAGON unit is satisfied with arrangement does not wish to revise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m touched, honestly, absurdly so, and I think this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve heard her actually express any sort of emotion or desire of her own, at least directly like that. &amp;quot;Satisfied with arrangement.&amp;quot; I suppose there are more eloquent ways to express that kind of sentiment—but I&amp;#39;ll take it just the same.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks,&amp;quot; I say, loudly enough for everyone listening to hear, and I&amp;#39;m suddenly aware of the wider scope to this little drama, all the other faces gathered round, watching, remembering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a legend,&lt;/em&gt; I think, &lt;em&gt;someday parents will tell this story to their children, even if we fail people will remember this. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that makes me feel motivated or terrified. Probably plenty of both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operator Kella will do well,&lt;/em&gt; she sends back, and I suppose I should have realized she would catch all of that, I&amp;#39;m not exactly in a guarded moment. I send another thanks to her, silently this time, because I&amp;#39;ve also got to say something now, it&amp;#39;s expected, it&amp;#39;s right for the moment, and I&amp;#39;m not ready but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;readiness is nice but now has the necessity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;and I breathe in deep and let my gaze scan the little crowd, gathering larger every moment.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m no good at speeches, I&amp;#39;m just a scavver really,&amp;quot; I say. &amp;quot;Speeches were Dad&amp;#39;s thing. Some of you knew him, a few others knew the kind of thing he and Mom were always looking for. Well, now I&amp;#39;ve found it. Found &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. She still needs a name, but like I told Kether just a few moments ago, she&amp;#39;s the best hope we&amp;#39;ve had in a long, long time. We need to meet and talk about going forward. This place is fine for now but soon enough she&amp;#39;ll outgrow it, and we won&amp;#39;t evade fey notice for too long.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I close my eyes, knowing I shouldn&amp;#39;t, I should project confidence in front of this crowd, this should be a legendary speech for a legendary beginning, but humanity gets what it gets, it gets me, I&amp;#39;ll just do my best and that&amp;#39;s all they can ask, all I can ask of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is all but best can improve, all can be added to, Operator Kella will have help grow with DRAGON unit not larger but other ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gods damn it all I&amp;#39;m sending again, but that&amp;#39;s alright, I send warmth back to her because that&amp;#39;s what the words give me and I don&amp;#39;t have time to process them right now even though they&amp;#39;re what I needed and I reach out, set my hand gently on the base of her neck, feeling what the little girl felt, surprisingly warm, dry and smooth-scaled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is still looking at me, not seeming to mind the pause. The moment overspills with possibility and I reach for one. It&amp;#39;s the only one, it&amp;#39;s an awful one, maybe no one left alive now knows how awful, we know the grind of oppression but this is a different kind of milling-stone I&amp;#39;m about to set in motion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can no longer just do what we can from the shadows, we will still need secrecy and guile on our side but now, we are going to become something else, now we are going to have to do something else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I let my words sink in for a pause, purposeful this time, then stand up straight, fingers tightening on the base of her long neck, feeling that slight give, almost-living.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, we go to war.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether&amp;#39;s eyes widen; I don&amp;#39;t have authority to declare anything like this, I don&amp;#39;t really have any authority at all. But I&amp;#39;ve said it, and people are listening, and I suppose that&amp;#39;s the only authority that really matters sometimes, and Kether&amp;#39;s about to speak but it&amp;#39;s cut off utterly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dragon roars.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My first thought, living here so long, is that it will attract the fey oh gods what are we going to do.

Crystalline. Ringing through the air with little hints of inner fire.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And the people roar back. That surprises me more. They roar their approval.

How do you keep finding me?!\" My head jerks around wildly as I strain to listen for the slightest hint of Mephisto\\'s position. Sometimes I can make out a scraping sound against the wall, but I think he\\'s fucking with me at this point.\\n\\nMephisto continues to stand about thirty feet away. He\\'s allowing me to put some distance between us, but any notion of escape is an illusion at this point. \"Ksss... My minionsss include not only the dead, the damned, and the decrepit... but the bugsss asss well. While you flee, left and right, through thisss passsage and that... the wallsss part for me. I sssee you, no matter where you run. You will be mine...\"\\n\\n_He can communicate with insects?_\\n\\nA quick stomp of my foot illuminates the room around me. Here and there, tiny imperfections on the walls display various bugs crawling around.\\n\\n_Damn! This bastard never lets up! While I run up and down the hallways like a chicken with its head cut off, he can travel through the walls and show up right in front of me!_\\n\\n_Okay... okay... if that\\'s the case, then focus! I can escape him! It isn\\'t impossible!_\\n\\nSeveral ideas appear in my mind. _Slay the bugs. Distract him. Fake left, but go right._\\n\\nHowever, there\\'s an even better idea. I don\\'t have to kill Mephisto\\'s spies if I can turn them against him.\\n\\nUnder my breath, I whisper, \"**Mirage. Shimmer. Illusion. Smoke.**\"\\n\\nAll around me, copies of my body appear. They\\'re hallucinations, fake Jasons to distract him. A cloud of smoke erupts, and my clones and I take off, racing away from the Duke. I shift left and right, dashing between each of my copies and shuffling them around.\\n\\nTo my surprise, I hear Mephisto hiss in anger. One of my copies registers a hit as he swings to hit them, his knife passing through their illusory body. I don\\'t look back, but instead smile as I hear him yell, \"What?! Foolisssh worm... you can\\'t ssstop me with tricksss! I\\'ll cut all of them to piecesss!\"\\n\\nEach of the mirages shares a mental link with me. When a path split appears up ahead, I run left with several hallucinations, while the others go right. _Every time you encounter a junction, break off from each other,_ I order them.\\n\\nThe mindless incorporeal copies don\\'t respond, but a tingle tells me they understand.\\n\\n_Good._ I continue running, and grumble as Mephisto lucks out and follows my crew and not the others. He continues to stab mirages one by one. When the next split appears, I whisper, \"**Waypoint.**\"\\n\\nIt\\'s only a hunch, but if this works, I might be onto something. Sometimes it\\'s almost funny how the threat of a demon chasing after me can get my almonds rolling.\\n\\nWordsmithing has infinite possible effects. Having played many video games in my life, I hypothesize that if I set a waypoint, I might be able to jump back to it. Teleportation is something I\\'ve strongly considered, but it also terrifies me. What if I teleport inside a wall and fuse into it? I could die!\\n\\nBut as everyone always says, there\\'s no time like the present. This Demon Duke won\\'t leave me alone!\\n\\nA split appears a hundred feet ahead. I scowl as the Duke of Mist slashes at yet another of my illusions, dissipating it into nothingness. \\n\\n_I have only a dozen mirages left. He\\'ll hit me soon. I don\\'t want that knife touching me._ The sensation of a million volts of electricity slamming into my spine was more than a _little_ unpleasant.\\n\\nWhen we split this time, I continue moving with only two clones. For a split-second, Mephisto pauses behind us and curses. \"Devilsss... what if thisss isssn\\'t even the right one?!\"\\n\\nHe relents a moment later and chases after me, making me grimace. _I almost lost him._\\n\\nOne slash, my rear mirage falls. Another slash, the final copy falls.\\n\\nUnder my breath, I choke out, \"**Waypoint. Return.**\"\\n\\nBoom.\\n\\nI vanish while running and reappear at my first checkpoint, slamming against the wall. The change of scenery only disorients me for a moment, and I quickly spot the bugs crawling on the walls. _Mephisto will figure out what I did within seconds. There\\'s no time to lose!_\\n\\n\"**Invisibility. Stealth.**\"\\n\\nTransforming my body in a way similar to Mephisto\\'s, I take off down the opposite corridor that I first went, heading left toward what I hope is freedom. My shoes become noiseless, neither squeaking nor scuffing the floor as I run. Without my sonar, I have no choice but to rely on my infrared vision to see.\\n\\nThis time, I spend an hour fleeing for my life. Left, right, up, down. Corridors and hallways pass me by the dozens. \\n\\nI slow down once I enter an area with several puddles splashed across the floor. My mental map tells me this biome is most likely a marine area, one with vast reservoirs of water.\\n\\nFireflies buzz about, here and there. The ones in the Labyrinth are significantly brighter than the ones I knew about on Earth, and they illuminate rooms like twenty-watt bulbs. They don\\'t do anything for me with my current vision, but seeing a lot of them means I must be nearing an area with a high monster density. Demons and monsters aren\\'t allowed to eat the fireflies.\\n\\nCreeping forth, I avoid puddles and squint at the ground, unable to make much out. My shoes produce no noise, and the cool temperature in this marine biome makes my infrared vision nearly worthless. My best bet is to follow the fireflies since they produce a small amount of heat as they buzz around and crawl on the Labyrinth\\'s walls.\\n\\n\"**Normalize,**\" I whisper, returning my body to its original loudness level. I keep the invisibility active, just in case. It\\'s slowly draining my energy, which is terrible, but at the same time, I don\\'t want to take any chances. Better to lay low and pray the Duke can\\'t find me.\\n\\nUsing my Telekinesis, I hover over the ground, slowly moving forward without splashing in puddles. Every so often, I grab a rock and tap the walls to light the way, but otherwise, I remain entirely silent.\\n\\nSplashing sounds in the distance, along with the voices of incredibly cute women, make my heart flutter. _Not this time,_ I think to myself. Sirens can go to hell.\\n\\n\"Oooh, hehehe...\" One of the girls coos to someone out of sight. As I draw closer to one walled-off alcove, a large opening reveals a massive demon with hulking armor sitting silently before a pool. Located before him is a giant pool of water, one where dozens of creatures splash around playfully. After a moment of observing them, I realize they aren\\'t sirens, but instead, mermaids.\\n\\n\"Barbatos, sweetie, are you feeling okay?\" One of the mermaids pulls herself out of the water and splashes onto the land beside the iron giant. I slow my hovering for a moment to observe their interaction. \"You were gone for over a month! Come on, take off all that armor, and we\\'ll show you a good time!\"\\n\\nThe demon shifts slightly, his heavy plates of steel grinding together. \"No need.\"\\n\\n\"I heard that nasty Black Witch hurt you! I can\\'t believe it, love! I thought you were invincible!\" While the mermaid crows at him, two others swim over and stop at the edge of the pool.\\n\\n\"Defeated. Yes. Agares, dead. I was lucky.\"\\n\\nThe demon\\'s voice is deep and ominous, yet tinged with sadness and melancholy. Only now do I remember his name. \\n\\n_Barbatos! He\\'s one of the Dukes of Hell! Shit. I can\\'t stay here. I barely escaped the last guy. What the fuck is wrong with me?_\\n\\nContinuing past the entrance, I start to hover away, only to freeze as Barbatos speaks. \"Intruder. Reveal yourself.\"\\n\\nMy heart slams. _Fuck that! This guy is the size of a mountain!_\\n\\nI land on my feet and start running, only to gasp in alarm. Without so much as disturbing the air, the metal monster appears in front of me.\\n\\n_Red flag! Danger!_ My mind screams at me to run, but I hesitate, unsure what my best move is.\\n\\nBarbatos stands, arms crossed. \"Show yourself.\"\\n\\nGuilty, I mutter under my breath, \"**Reveal.**\"\\n\\nAs my body reforms, the Duke\\'s helmet shifts slightly. \"Human?\"\\n\\n\"If it\\'s a fight you want,\" I say, raising my tiny fists and striking a pose, \"I\\'ll give it to you.\"\\n\\nBarbatos is several inches taller than me. His armor adds to his size, making him appear nearly eight feet tall. However, despite his intimidating appearance, the Duke makes no motion to fight. \"Sacred place. Leave. Never return.\"\\n\\nI stare dumbly. \"W-what? You\\'re letting me go?\"\\n\\n\"Fighting. War. Unending. Not for me. My creed. Protect friends only.\"\\n\\n\"Ohhh. O-okay then, big guy. Well, uh, th-thanks.\"\\n\\nSlowly, I take a few steps away, careful not to turn my back on him. The Duke doesn\\'t move. Returning from the direction I came, I creep past the mermaid alcove. \\n\\nTwo of the mermaids hiss at me. I ignore them.\\n\\nOnce my spherical vision can no longer make out Barbatos\\'s form in the distance, I turn and quicken my pace, vigilantly ensuring I don\\'t step in and puddles of water.\\n\\n_Never return,_ echoes Barbatos\\'s voice in my head.\\n\\nMy teeth grind together as I shiver in fear. _Hey man, no problem. I\\'m sorry I bugged ya, pal. Have fun with the mermaids!_\\n\\n............................................................\\n\\nSigh... today is getting worse minute by minute.\\n\\n\"Gwahaha! You lost him?! What an idiot!\" Bael roars and slaps his knee while guffawing at Mephisto. I stare Bael down until he realizes his laughter is annoying me. He tapers off and rubs his nose. \"Err, sorry, boss.\"\\n\\n\"Mephisto,\" I begin, turning away from Bael, \"Where did you last see the human?\"\\n\\nThe Duke of Mist twitches his boney fingers impatiently. \"Ksss. Emperor Diablo, the flessshbag wasss only inchesss in front of me, and then he disssappeared. Hisss copiesss sssplit up and made it difficult for me to follow.\"\\n\\nI nod slowly. \"So when you say he vanished, you mean you slashed the copy, and then it dissolved like the others?\"\\n\\nMephisto bows his head. \"Nay. The flessshbag vanissshed before I could ssstrike hisss back.\"\\n\\n\"Teleportation, then, in addition to illusory magic and a blade of light that can cut through anything. This Jason fellow has a veritable grab bag of powers. Damn. I should have questioned Beelzebub more about the human\\'s abilities. Defeating a Lord isn\\'t a small task, even if he is a Hero.\"\\n\\nBael rolls his eyes. \"I\\'ve seen some weak heroes in my life. Remember that guy with no legs?\"\\n\\n\"How could I forget?\"\\n\\n\"Dunno.\"\\n\\nA moment of silence passes while I contemplate how to capture this newly awakened Hero.\\n\\nBael glowers at me. \"Hey. Boss. Do... do you think that the sword Beelzebub saw was...\"\\n\\n\"Excalibur? Not a chance. If the human possessed Excalibur, we\\'d know by now. Hell itself could be rent in half if that weapon fell into a Hero\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nBael chuckles slightly. \"Hehe. Okay, good. I was a little worried, ya know?\"\\n\\n\"So am I,\" I mutter. \"A Hero and the Black Queen. One alone under ordinary circumstances would be an emergency, but both at once...\"\\n\\nMephisto\\'s head twitches. \"I ssshould contact Umi. Ssshe is our bessst Oracle. Ssshe will help us find that flessshbag, and then-\"\\n\\n\"No. We have bigger problems to worry about.\" I hold up a palm to silence Mephisto. \"So far, Jason hasn\\'t caused us any problems. I\\'m much more worried about what he said regarding Amelia. If she\\'s alive and devouring another planet, we may be too late to stop her. We\\'ve already lost Agares, and the Overlords won\\'t take kindly to us requesting the destruction of a second planet. They\\'ll think me incompetent.\" \\n\\nI pause for a moment to consider my options. \"Mephisto, I want you to scour the Labyrinth and find out where that damn Belial is hiding. If she doesn\\'t help us, we\\'ll never defeat Amelia.\"\\n\\nBael\\'s smile melts away, and a look of worry crosses his face. \"Say, boss, what if when you fought the little witch, you used-\"\\n\\n\"No. Don\\'t even whisper what you\\'re thinking out loud. I\\'ll never unleash that power again.\" \\n\\nMephisto cocks his head curiously, but I don\\'t answer the question in his eyes.\\n\\n_I only used my power once. I damn near killed every other demon in existence. If I lose control like that again, nobody here will be able to stop me._\\n\\nAn Emperor\\'s job is to oversee all the other demons. I have to keep them alive, happy, and healthy... not necessarily in that order. Matters of war should almost always be for the Dukes. Besides, if I die, who will lead? Bael? Belial?\\n\\nNo. A recluse of a First Emperor, a whore of a Second, and an idiot for my First Duke. I\\'m the only remotely capable demon here.\\n\\nI wish it didn\\'t have to be that way. _Ruling is such a devil-damned pain in the ass._\\n\\n\"You heard me, Mephisto. Find Belial. No second-guessing my orders. Bael and I will hunt that human down. With luck, he\\'ll lead us right to the Black Queen... and checkmate.\"\\n\\n\"Keh keh keh... asss you command, Emperor Diablo.\" Mephisto says with a bow. A moment later, he turns around and fades into the wall.\\n\\nBael and I start walking down the passageway opposite where the human vanished. He nudges me. \"C\\'mon, boss. If you use your transformation when other demons ain\\'t around, there shouldn\\'t be a problem, right? The Black Bitch will be on a human planet! Nobody will get hurt but her!\"\\n\\nI nod. \"I know, Bael. However, that sick taste in my heart was something I never wish to experience again. It\\'s not something I can put into words.\"\\n\\nBael nods, and for once, he takes a moment to think before he speaks.\\n\\n\"Well, if that\\'s the way you feel, ain\\'t no way I\\'m convincin\\' ya. Anyway, I can\\'t wait to wrap my hands around the little bitch\\'s neck. Agares owed me three blood pies! Now I\\'ll never get \\'em!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you have your priorities in order,\" I mutter.\\n\\n\"Thanks, boss.\"\\n\\nSighing, I avert my eyes. _If Bael ever ran the Labyrinth; our kind would go extinct within a hundred years._\\n\\n_Count on it._\\n\\n.......................................\\n\\n**Author Note:**\\n\\n**[This is Barbatos with the mermaids.](https://i.imgur.com/BoJdIk6.jpg)**\\n\\n**[This is Barbatos with the mermaids, but an outdated character design.](https://i.imgur.com/UufEuP0.jpg)**',\n",

How do you keep finding me?!&amp;quot; My head jerks around wildly as I strain to listen for the slightest hint of Mephisto&amp;#39;s position. Sometimes I can make out a scraping sound against the wall, but I think he&amp;#39;s fucking with me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto continues to stand about thirty feet away. He&amp;#39;s allowing me to put some distance between us, but any notion of escape is an illusion at this point. &amp;quot;Ksss... My minionsss include not only the dead, the damned, and the decrepit... but the bugsss asss well. While you flee, left and right, through thisss passsage and that... the wallsss part for me. I sssee you, no matter where you run. You will be mine...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He can communicate with insects?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A quick stomp of my foot illuminates the room around me. Here and there, tiny imperfections on the walls display various bugs crawling around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn! This bastard never lets up! While I run up and down the hallways like a chicken with its head cut off, he can travel through the walls and show up right in front of me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay... okay... if that&amp;#39;s the case, then focus! I can escape him! It isn&amp;#39;t impossible!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Several ideas appear in my mind. &lt;em&gt;Slay the bugs. Distract him. Fake left, but go right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s an even better idea. I don&amp;#39;t have to kill Mephisto&amp;#39;s spies if I can turn them against him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Under my breath, I whisper, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Mirage. Shimmer. Illusion. Smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All around me, copies of my body appear. They&amp;#39;re hallucinations, fake Jasons to distract him. A cloud of smoke erupts, and my clones and I take off, racing away from the Duke. I shift left and right, dashing between each of my copies and shuffling them around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I hear Mephisto hiss in anger. One of my copies registers a hit as he swings to hit them, his knife passing through their illusory body. I don&amp;#39;t look back, but instead smile as I hear him yell, &amp;quot;What?! Foolisssh worm... you can&amp;#39;t ssstop me with tricksss! I&amp;#39;ll cut all of them to piecesss!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each of the mirages shares a mental link with me.

When the next split appears, I whisper, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Waypoint.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only a hunch, but if this works, I might be onto something. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s almost funny how the threat of a demon chasing after me can get my almonds rolling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Wordsmithing has infinite possible effects. Having played many video games in my life, I hypothesize that if I set a waypoint, I might be able to jump back to it. Teleportation is something I&amp;#39;ve strongly considered, but it also terrifies me. What if I teleport inside a wall and fuse into it? I could die!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But as everyone always says, there&amp;#39;s no time like the present. This Demon Duke won&amp;#39;t leave me alone!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A split appears a hundred feet ahead. I scowl as the Duke of Mist slashes at yet another of my illusions, dissipating it into nothingness. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have only a dozen mirages left. He&amp;#39;ll hit me soon. I don&amp;#39;t want that knife touching me.&lt;/em&gt; The sensation of a million volts of electricity slamming into my spine was more than a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we split this time, I continue moving with only two clones. For a split-second, Mephisto pauses behind us and curses. &amp;quot;Devilsss... what if thisss isssn&amp;#39;t even the right one?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He relents a moment later and chases after me, making me grimace. &lt;em&gt;I almost lost him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One slash, my rear mirage falls. Another slash, the final copy falls.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Under my breath, I choke out, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Waypoint. Return.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Boom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I vanish while running and reappear at my first checkpoint, slamming against the wall. The change of scenery only disorients me for a moment, and I quickly spot the bugs crawling on the walls. &lt;em&gt;Mephisto will figure out what I did within seconds. There&amp;#39;s no time to lose!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Invisibility. Stealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Transforming my body in a way similar to Mephisto&amp;#39;s, I take off down the opposite corridor that I first went, heading left toward what I hope is freedom. My shoes become noiseless, neither squeaking nor scuffing the floor as I run. Without my sonar, I have no choice but to rely on my infrared vision to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, I spend an hour fleeing for my life. Left, right, up, down. Corridors and hallways pass me by the dozens. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slow down once I enter an area with several puddles splashed across the floor. My mental map tells me this biome is most likely a marine area, one with vast reservoirs of water.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fireflies buzz about, here and there.

Sirens can go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oooh, hehehe...&amp;quot; One of the girls coos to someone out of sight. As I draw closer to one walled-off alcove, a large opening reveals a massive demon with hulking armor sitting silently before a pool. Located before him is a giant pool of water, one where dozens of creatures splash around playfully. After a moment of observing them, I realize they aren&amp;#39;t sirens, but instead, mermaids.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Barbatos, sweetie, are you feeling okay?&amp;quot; One of the mermaids pulls herself out of the water and splashes onto the land beside the iron giant. I slow my hovering for a moment to observe their interaction. &amp;quot;You were gone for over a month! Come on, take off all that armor, and we&amp;#39;ll show you a good time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The demon shifts slightly, his heavy plates of steel grinding together. &amp;quot;No need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I heard that nasty Black Witch hurt you! I can&amp;#39;t believe it, love! I thought you were invincible!&amp;quot; While the mermaid crows at him, two others swim over and stop at the edge of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Defeated. Yes. Agares, dead. I was lucky.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The demon&amp;#39;s voice is deep and ominous, yet tinged with sadness and melancholy. Only now do I remember his name. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barbatos! He&amp;#39;s one of the Dukes of Hell! Shit. I can&amp;#39;t stay here. I barely escaped the last guy. What the fuck is wrong with me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Continuing past the entrance, I start to hover away, only to freeze as Barbatos speaks. &amp;quot;Intruder. Reveal yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart slams. &lt;em&gt;Fuck that! This guy is the size of a mountain!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I land on my feet and start running, only to gasp in alarm. Without so much as disturbing the air, the metal monster appears in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red flag! Danger!&lt;/em&gt; My mind screams at me to run, but I hesitate, unsure what my best move is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Barbatos stands, arms crossed. &amp;quot;Show yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guilty, I mutter under my breath, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As my body reforms, the Duke&amp;#39;s helmet shifts slightly. &amp;quot;Human?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If it&amp;#39;s a fight you want,&amp;quot; I say, raising my tiny fists and striking a pose, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll give it to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Barbatos is several inches taller than me. His armor adds to his size, making him appear nearly eight feet tall. However, despite his intimidating appearance, the Duke makes no motion to fight. &amp;quot;Sacred place. Leave. Never return.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stare dumbly. &amp;quot;W-what? You&amp;#39;re letting me go?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fighting. War. Unending. Not for me. My creed. Protect friends only.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ohhh. O-okay then, big guy. Well, uh, th-thanks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, I take a few steps away, careful not to turn my back on him. The Duke doesn&amp;#39;t move. Returning from the direction I came, I creep past the mermaid alcove. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the mermaids hiss at me. I ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once my spherical vision can no longer make out Barbatos&amp;#39;s form in the distance, I turn and quicken my pace, vigilantly ensuring I don&amp;#39;t step in and puddles of water.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never return,&lt;/em&gt; echoes Barbatos&amp;#39;s voice in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My teeth grind together as I shiver in fear. &lt;em&gt;Hey man, no problem. I&amp;#39;m sorry I bugged ya, pal. Have fun with the mermaids!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;............................................................&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sigh... today is getting worse minute by minute.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gwahaha! You lost him?! What an idiot!&amp;quot; Bael roars and slaps his knee while guffawing at Mephisto. I stare Bael down until he realizes his laughter is annoying me. He tapers off and rubs his nose. &amp;quot;Err, sorry, boss.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mephisto,&amp;quot; I begin, turning away from Bael, &amp;quot;Where did you last see the human?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Duke of Mist twitches his boney fingers impatiently. &amp;quot;Ksss. Emperor Diablo, the flessshbag wasss only inchesss in front of me, and then he disssappeared. Hisss copiesss sssplit up and made it difficult for me to follow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nod slowly. &amp;quot;So when you say he vanished, you mean you slashed the copy, and then it dissolved like the others?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto bows his head. &amp;quot;Nay. The flessshbag vanissshed before I could ssstrike hisss back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Teleportation, then, in addition to illusory magic and a blade of light that can cut through anything. This Jason fellow has a veritable grab bag of powers. Damn. I should have questioned Beelzebub more about the human&amp;#39;s abilities. Defeating a Lord isn&amp;#39;t a small task, even if he is a Hero.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael rolls his eyes. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve seen some weak heroes in my life. Remember that guy with no legs?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How could I forget?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dunno.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A moment of silence passes while I contemplate how to capture this newly awakened Hero.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael glowers at me. &amp;quot;Hey. Boss. Do... do you think that the sword Beelzebub saw was...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excalibur? Not a chance. If the human possessed Excalibur, we&amp;#39;d know by now. Hell itself could be rent in half if that weapon fell into a Hero&amp;#39;s hands.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael chuckles slightly. &amp;quot;Hehe. Okay, good. I was a little worried, ya know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So am I,&amp;quot; I mutter. &amp;quot;A Hero and the Black Queen. One alone under ordinary circumstances would be an emergency, but both at once...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto&amp;#39;s head twitches. &amp;quot;I ssshould contact Umi. Ssshe is our bessst Oracle. Ssshe will help us find that flessshbag, and then-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. We have bigger problems to worry about.&amp;quot; I hold up a palm to silence Mephisto. &amp;quot;So far, Jason hasn&amp;#39;t caused us any problems. I&amp;#39;m much more worried about what he said regarding Amelia. If she&amp;#39;s alive and devouring another planet, we may be too late to stop her. We&amp;#39;ve already lost Agares, and the Overlords won&amp;#39;t take kindly to us requesting the destruction of a second planet. They&amp;#39;ll think me incompetent.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pause for a moment to consider my options. &amp;quot;Mephisto, I want you to scour the Labyrinth and find out where that damn Belial is hiding. If she doesn&amp;#39;t help us, we&amp;#39;ll never defeat Amelia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael&amp;#39;s smile melts away, and a look of worry crosses his face. &amp;quot;Say, boss, what if when you fought the little witch, you used-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Don&amp;#39;t even whisper what you&amp;#39;re thinking out loud. I&amp;#39;ll never unleash that power again.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto cocks his head curiously, but I don&amp;#39;t answer the question in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I only used my power once. I damn near killed every other demon in existence. If I lose control like that again, nobody here will be able to stop me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An Emperor&amp;#39;s job is to oversee all the other demons. I have to keep them alive, happy, and healthy... not necessarily in that order. Matters of war should almost always be for the Dukes. Besides, if I die, who will lead? Bael? Belial?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No. A recluse of a First Emperor, a whore of a Second, and an idiot for my First Duke. I&amp;#39;m the only remotely capable demon here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wish it didn&amp;#39;t have to be that way. &lt;em&gt;Ruling is such a devil-damned pain in the ass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You heard me, Mephisto. Find Belial. No second-guessing my orders. Bael and I will hunt that human down. With luck, he&amp;#39;ll lead us right to the Black Queen... and checkmate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keh keh keh... asss you command, Emperor Diablo.&amp;quot; Mephisto says with a bow. A moment later, he turns around and fades into the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael and I start walking down the passageway opposite where the human vanished. He nudges me. &amp;quot;C&amp;#39;mon, boss. If you use your transformation when other demons ain&amp;#39;t around, there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem, right? The Black Bitch will be on a human planet! Nobody will get hurt but her!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nod. &amp;quot;I know, Bael. However, that sick taste in my heart was something I never wish to experience again. It&amp;#39;s not something I can put into words.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael nods, and for once, he takes a moment to think before he speaks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, if that&amp;#39;s the way you feel, ain&amp;#39;t no way I&amp;#39;m convincin&amp;#39; ya. Anyway, I can&amp;#39;t wait to wrap my hands around the little bitch&amp;#39;s neck. Agares owed me three blood pies! Now I&amp;#39;ll never get &amp;#39;em!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m glad you have your priorities in order,&amp;quot; I mutter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks, boss.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sighing, I avert my eyes. &lt;em&gt;If Bael ever ran the Labyrinth; our kind would go extinct within a hundred years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Count on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;.......................................&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BoJdIk6.jpg\"&gt;This is Barbatos with the mermaids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/UufEuP0.jpg\"&gt;This is Barbatos with the mermaids, but an outdated character design.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Greg\\'s thoughts were drown out by the roar, and as it sped away he wondered why the feminine figure had on such immense padding. Her black leather bodysuit had seemed bulky in many places, and her sleek bike had two large black containers on either side of the rear wheel well. Greg wondered how she could ride hunched over and forward like she was for any kind of distance those travel bags implied.\\n\\n\"She seems to have somewhere to be. We\\'re going eighty and she just blew right by us!\" Greg told Kim, trying to small-talk her out of her concerned funk that had grown from her parents being unresponsive.\\n\\n\"Fuckin\\' crazy lady probably getting the fuck out of here before a mass fucking exodus,\" Kim ground out in a pained grumble. When the bike had roared by, her head had renewed its migraine intensity. She rubbed her head and drank some water. \"Or she\\'s heading the same direction we are. She just exited the same way we\\'re going. Fuckin cut off an auto-hauler too! Crazy bitch.\"\\n\\nGreg chuckled and rubbed her arm, trying to soothe her pained head. A moment later he exited the highway that circled the city, and saw John following behind do the same. Several hundred yards ahead down the access road he saw the biker turn off into the neighborhood that Kim\\'s parent\\'s lived in. He glanced over to see Kim had her eyes shut, and decided to keep the further coincidence to himself. By the time he took the turn into the rich neighborhood, the biker was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nFifteen minutes of driving past towering trees and massive properties lead the two-car caravan to a private drive that snaked up a large slope. The drive was gated, but Kim reminded him of the code and Greg pulled forward enough for John to follow them in. Climbing the hill was difficult for the over-loaded stolen suburban, but a few minutes later Greg was rounding the top of the hill and cruising toward the six-car garage. Kim\\'s parents had built on a hill that was surrounded by several other hills. Once visibility of the full three stories was achieved it was only another hundred yards to the parking area. Greg smoothly pulled the car in beyond the massive garage and turned the corner to park in front of the guest house out of habit. His hand froze halfway to the shifter when he saw the sleek black and chrome bike leaning against the stone wall of the side entrance ramp to the house proper. A short-haired brunette was leaning against the wall with the bike, a motorcycle helmet gripped in one hand, and a cigarette clutched in the first two fingers of the other.\\n\\n\"Who in the actual fuck is this lady and why is she at my parent\\'s house?\" Kim wondered aloud.\\n\\nGreg glanced to his left to see John staring at the brunette, a confused look on his face. \"I don\\'t know baby, but I\\'ll go find out what she wants. Maybe she knows your folks?\" Greg doubted that he would like the answer to his own question when a faint chill slid down his spine.\\n\\nThe tall brunette was taking a deep drag, both feet a fair distance apart, firmly planted on the ground, and didn\\'t break her staring contest with the clouds when Greg stepped from the vehicle and approached. He never took his eyes off her as he signalled John and Raven to stay in their car. Greg placed both hands on his daggers, stopping only five feet from the woman and her bike.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t need those for me. I\\'m human, and not here to hurt you.\" The woman spoke in a perfectly neutral accent. Each word exact, mundane, and direct. \"We are on the same side, you four and I. Kim\\'s parents aren\\'t here. I need to speak with Raven.\"\\n\\nGreg stood with his mouth half open, staring at the woman that still stared skyward. He had been about to speak when she had begun the exchange instead. Caught off guard by the quantity of information shoved into so few words, Greg closed his mouth to take a deep breath and smooth out his response. \"How do you know this house, and how do you know Kim and Raven? Why should I believe anything you say?\"\\n\\n\"Who the fuck are you, lady?!\" Kim yelled from her side of the suburban as she closed the passenger door and flung open the side door for Shadow to slink out.\\n\\nThe large cat crept around Greg to flank the woman from her other side. When Shadow rounded out her flank, she stared up quizzically at the right side of the woman\\'s face. After a moment of silent regard, Shadow glanced between Greg, Kim, John and Raven in their car, and back to the brunette, then sat down on her haunches to continue studying the woman. Greg\\'s eyebrow went up when he realized the large feline had failed to garner a reaction.\\n\\nThe woman took a deep drag of her cigarette, cracked a small grin while she exhaled, and spoke to the sky once more. \"I\\'ll get her question out of the way first. I am Officer Silver. Katelyn Silver is my actual name, so it only sounds like my bosses like weird code names. You can all call me Kate. As for your questions, Gregory, I don\\'t personally know any of you. I have however been tasked with a mission concerning all of you.\"\\n\\nGreg glanced back at John and Raven, both of whom were still in Raven\\'s SUV. The confused look on Raven\\'s face told Greg everything he needed to know. \"Well none of us know you, and we have our own things that we need to be seeing to, so have a good day and please get off this property.\"\\n\\nKate smirked, dropping her cigarette to the ground after a final drag. Finally looking away from the sky to glance at the ground as she stepped on her cigarette and twisted her heavy black combat boot to snuff the embers. Kate shifted without moving her feet to face Greg. He heard a squeak from Raven\\'s open window, and Kim brought forth fire, covering her right hand in a ball of swirling crimson flames. While Kate\\'s left eye was a striking blue, her right eye was what had drawn reactions. A silver orb with a dull blue light at its center sat where her natural born eye had once been. The eye\\'s blue light burned at Greg,  and he realized that Kate had a storm cloud growing behind her natural eye.\\n\\n\"I am sure you think to search this house yourself, but I assure you that it is quite empty. Now we only have five minutes for me to relay a message to Raven and get all four of you heading toward our objective.\" Kate maintained her glare on Greg as she flung her hand up at Kim before she could start on a tirade. \"My people are looking for your parents as we speak. Last report said that they were in Colorado. We\\'ll get them out too if you come with me and help us get ready. We\\'re on Enlightenment protocol, so I can freely answer any question I have the answers for later. For now, Raven\\'s dad demanded that we ensure her safe conduct to The Bastion.\"\\n\\nGreg\\'s eyes nearly fell from his head as he stared at the tall, imposing woman and tried to put together the barrage of information. She was nearly as tall as he, putting her at couple inches over six feet tall. No one made a sound for several heartbeats until Greg swallowed hard and took a step toward Raven\\'s door. \"Hand over the message and I\\'ll pass it to her, then.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. We are wasting time. We have less than four minutes to be away from here.\" Kate underhand tossed a small flat black square with a silvery dome in the center to Greg, who delicately caught the device in both hands. He passed it to Raven and she looked at the black and silver metal in confusion.\\n\\n\"Oh just put it on the dash and push down on the top. We Need To Go!\" Kate told Raven, emphasizing the last words with impatient urgency.\\n\\nRaven glared at the woman before doing as she had been told, her hand returning to her lap to clamp her other. The device then clicked softly several times before the multitude of small dimples on the silvery dome hissed open. Several hair-thin rods extended out four inches from the device. Small metal plates extended out from each rod to reach out and connect to the neighboring rods. In seconds the device had become a miniature satellite dish wish a soft blue glow emanating from its rim. Tiny beams of light streamed up into the center, and a cascade of light motes drifted up in a swirl. A sphere formed and shimmered, rippling with a static reminiscent of early television models.\\n\\nKate had gotten out another cigarette while everyone was glued to the high-tech device booting up. Greg reached out a hand, silently requesting a smoke. Kim grunted softly when Kate handed one over, a small bull\\'s snort coming from her nose. Greg pretended not to notice, lighting up as the image of an older man coalesced from the blue light on Raven\\'s dash. Color seeped into the image as it smoothed out into a white-haired tightly kept military man. His name tag was a blur, the image resolution failing to clarify the individual letters. Five stars formed a circle on the outer end of the top of each shoulder, along with several other insignias Greg didn\\'t recognize. He knew the five circular stars meant that the man was a five-star general, and that meant he was one of the most powerful men in the country, if not the world.\\n\\nRaven\\'s eyes glittered weekly with tears, a hand covering her shocked expression. \"Pops?\" She asked quietly, a tear sliding down her cheek as the image fully resolved.\\n\\nThe man\\'s hologram rubbed his throat, reached down out of view of the holo, and began to speak in a gruff baritone. \"Raven, I need you to go with Katelyn. I\\'m told you four are very short on time and need to be on the move. Tell Kate to inform Kim and Greg that their parents locations have been confirmed and they will be safe soon. We know you have questions, but there is no time for answering them right now. Kate is one of my best; she will keep you safe.\"\\n\\nRaven took in a slow, deep breath before sighing out a soft, \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my girl. Stay strong, and stay aware. You\\'re in more danger than you might know.\" The man\\'s image shifted toward Greg before continuing. \"Keep my little girl safe, but make sure you all make it out to The Bastion.\" The general turned to Kate then, \"Get going, officer. Stay safe, and godspeed.\" With that, the general nodded to Raven with a faint smile and reached down out of sight once more. \"I love you, little bird. I\\'ll see you soon,\" he said before the communication was cut.\\n\\n\"Okay, well then, uh.. I think I\\'m convinced. What now?\" Greg said, offering a shocked Kim a shrug and a shy grin.\\n\\n\"Fuck it, I\\'m sold. My parents would have come out here by now- the house would have alerted them to our being out here. Where the fuck is this bastion?\" Kim directed the last toward Kate.\\n\\nKate\\'s head whipped around to look toward the drive on the other side of the garages, took three long, powerful strides to her motorcycle, flipping open one of the saddle-bags. Several small black drones darted out, racing high into the air before circling out in a five mote spiral. \"Heat signatures detected on all sides. Five groups of six to ten un-identifieds. Closest is one-hundred and twenty eight yards out and coming up the drive. We took too long.\" Two black cubes appeared in her hands and she tossed one to Raven and the other to Kim. \"Communicators. The Bastion is a secure location to the west. I will not say more in as unsecure an environment as we are in.\"\\n\\nSeveral sharp whistling sounds came from five separate directions at the same time as Kate turned her engine over. \"The darter drones are luring away our uninvited guests. Mount up and stay close! Greg and Kim, take the rear. John- keep that thing ten feet off my ass. Let\\'s Move!\" Kate gave such strong orders that Greg found himself obeying immediately.\\n\\nShadow leapt from the side wall and slipped into the packed interior. Kim grunted irritably, closing the side door and hopping into the passenger seat once more. Greg heard the electric motor of Raven\\'s sleek SUV spin up the moment before he started his own. Kate lead John in a tight circle, turning toward the entry road without rounding the corner of the massive garage. Greg followed suit, but in the small rear parking area he only had enough room to get near to being in line without actually lining up straight. A dark howl reverberated off of the windows of the house and through their vehicles.\\n\\nKate\\'s raised left hand was held in a fist until a howl sounded again from another direction. Her hand formed a knife that slashed forward and straight out. Her other hand cranked the motorcycle\\'s throttle, launching her forward. John accelerated hard in an attempt to stay close, while Greg too floored the accelerator and tore away from the empty mansion. Greg heard several enraged howls from behind and beside them as they topped the main hill and began to weave down the slope.\\n\\nShadow began to growl from her cubby beneath the supplies, her tail thumping as it lashed the bottom and sides of the containers. Greg saw small black objects taking flight from the saddle-bags once again as Kate lead the procession, obviously holding back on her throttle to keep close to the vehicles. The drones darted out in all directions, with four streaking for the road outside of Kim\\'s parent\\'s property. Tires squealed as the two heavily burdened SUVs tore around the final curve of driveway and made for the main gate. The gate hung open limply, one of the drones perched atop the control box, which spat out sparks and smoke. Kate turned right onto the street before skidding her rear tire around her front in a dangerous, and loud, turn-about maneuver.\\n\\nThe small communicator crackled to life in Kim\\'s jacket pocket. \"LEFT! NOW!\" Kate\\'s voice was urgent, and she thrust her hand toward the ordered direction.\\n\\nJohn accelerated hard onto the open street, scattering random plant and tree debris as the car lurched crazily for a moment before leveling out. Greg followed suit, fishtailing heavily as the suburban\\'s heavy rear and contents shifted the vehicle to nearly perpendicular to the street. Greg heaved on the wheel and swung the rear back around before finally getting the vehicle straightened out and straining up the neighborhood street. Kate\\'s motorcycle roared by on the passenger side, and Greg saw a massive pistol gripped in her gloved left hand. A moment later an explosion came from several hundred feet behind them on the street leading to the property they had just abandoned.  The large column of fire was visible in the side view mirrors for the seconds before they crested the current hill.\\n\\nAnother explosion ripped through the woods on their left, prompting more howling. Greg could see the light from the blast and felt the car vibrate from the shockwave. Two heartbeats and two explosions later they were careening around a corner and onto the main road of the neighborhood.\\n\\nA slick black sports car swerved to avoid Kate as she flew out of the side street. \"Don\\'t brake!\" She ordered as she swerved into oncoming traffic, causing several vehicles to slam on their brakes and creating a gap in the light traffic for John and Greg to enter the street at speed.\\n\\nGreg took a deep, nerve filled breath and exhaled slowly before chuckling nervously and glancing at Kim. \"I think she might know what she\\'s doing, hun. This is goi-\"\\n\\nGreg cut his words off, his jaw snapping shut with a click. He saw a massive quadrupedal figure burst from the woods a hundred yards ahead, clearing the twelve foot security fence to the richest neighborhood in the area to land directly on an old sedan. The car crumpled and shattered as several massive spikes punched through roof, trunk, hood, and the street around it. The towering figure looked like a cross between wolf, rhinoceros and bramble patch. The four powerful legs had spikes protruding from each armor plated segment as well as the three joints on each leg. Instead of feet it looked to have several spiked appendages. The armored head looked like the spiked end of a medieval mace, spikes jutting out one, two, or even three feet in most directions.\\n\\nThe sharp angle of the beastly muzzle reminded Greg of a bird of prey until it opened wide to reveal hundreds of jagged black teeth. The massive jaws ripped open the vehicle it had landed on, ripping its driver in half. Cars crashed and came to swerving halts before the beast, and sped away in horror beyond it, the beast roared while dozens of hellhounds tore through the fence and onto the street. Two drones sped from Kate\\'s bike, one impacting the large beast as the other slammed into the iron fence. Two massive explosions tore through the area, now only twenty yards away from Greg. Kate was nearly beyond them and John was close behind her.\\n\\nThe beast roared, rounding angry more than hurt, and several hellhounds stumbled into the street, shaking their heads and stamping clawed feet. One sprinted into the street and lunged across the median at John and Raven\\'s vehicle. John swerved, almost managing to avoid the savage claws as one set of claws latched onto the very rear of the car\\'s left side. The hellhound skidded and bounced as John tried to dislodge the beast with erratic driving. Greg swerved too and kept the accelerator floored.\\n\\nThe massive spiked beast lumbered forward, dragging the crushed car for several yards before it dislodged, tearing away in a shriek of rending metal. Greg swerved to the opposite side of the street, managing to avoid the massive spiked arm that broke the street where they would have been.\\n\\nThe hellhound that had latched one claw onto Raven\\'s SUV began to pull itself up, getting a second clawed hand into the vehicle\\'s rear. John swerved hard, swinging around a vehicle at nearly seventy miles per hour and managed to clip the hellhound on the rear of the vehicle. The beast roared in anger at its lost grip on its prey even as it pinwheeled through the air several yards above the road.\\n\\nGreg swerved to avoid a car on the opposite side of the street as he wove his way through the chaos and auto-cars and hellhounds. He saw the hellhound get swung out wide on the rear of the SUV, but another one leapt for him from the median. Kim grunted in effort and he saw the hellhound rocket higher into the air, clearing the top of the suburban by many feet.\\n\\n\"FUCK!\" Kim shouted, drawing Greg\\'s attention back to their mad dash. She threw her hands out as Greg pulled the wheel and reflexively slammed the brakes in an effort to dodge the hellhound flying into their windshield. The beast had tumbled through the air to land perfectly on their hood the instant Greg had brought his attention forward again.\\n\\nThe hood of the vehicle caved in heavily as the beast rolled up it, slamming into the windshield in a spray of glass and flailing spiked and clawed appendages.',\n",

I have had an incredibly long couple of weeks that started with a fight and my house getting trashed and just ended with my girlfriend and I&amp;#39;s first ever art festival that we sold our things at. And a minor concussion. But hey, I&amp;#39;m not dead; I still exist! I&amp;#39;d also like to give a massive thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/Plucium\"&gt;u/Plucium&lt;/a&gt; for being awesome and hitting me up to make sure everything was alright. Twas a giant morale boost, mate, so thank you! And as always, any critiques, spell checking, etc is very welcome and appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cm4duc/primal_essence_ch1/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;First Chapter&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d5eiik/primal_essence_ch_18/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;] [[Next]]&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A motorcycle engine roared as a sleek black and chrome bike raced by. Greg&amp;#39;s thoughts were drown out by the roar, and as it sped away he wondered why the feminine figure had on such immense padding. Her black leather bodysuit had seemed bulky in many places, and her sleek bike had two large black containers on either side of the rear wheel well. Greg wondered how she could ride hunched over and forward like she was for any kind of distance those travel bags implied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She seems to have somewhere to be. We&amp;#39;re going eighty and she just blew right by us!&amp;quot; Greg told Kim, trying to small-talk her out of her concerned funk that had grown from her parents being unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuckin&amp;#39; crazy lady probably getting the fuck out of here before a mass fucking exodus,&amp;quot; Kim ground out in a pained grumble. When the bike had roared by, her head had renewed its migraine intensity. She rubbed her head and drank some water. &amp;quot;Or she&amp;#39;s heading the same direction we are. She just exited the same way we&amp;#39;re going. Fuckin cut off an auto-hauler too! Crazy bitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg chuckled and rubbed her arm, trying to soothe her pained head. A moment later he exited the highway that circled the city, and saw John following behind do the same. Several hundred yards ahead down the access road he saw the biker turn off into the neighborhood that Kim&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s lived in. He glanced over to see Kim had her eyes shut, and decided to keep the further coincidence to himself. By the time he took the turn into the rich neighborhood, the biker was nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes of driving past towering trees and massive properties lead the two-car caravan to a private drive that snaked up a large slope. The drive was gated, but Kim reminded him of the code and Greg pulled forward enough for John to follow them in. Climbing the hill was difficult for the over-loaded stolen suburban, but a few minutes later Greg was rounding the top of the hill and cruising toward the six-car garage. Kim&amp;#39;s parents had built on a hill that was surrounded by several other hills. Once visibility of the full three stories was achieved it was only another hundred yards to the parking area. Greg smoothly pulled the car in beyond the massive garage and turned the corner to park in front of the guest house out of habit. His hand froze halfway to the shifter when he saw the sleek black and chrome bike leaning against the stone wall of the side entrance ramp to the house proper. A short-haired brunette was leaning against the wall with the bike, a motorcycle helmet gripped in one hand, and a cigarette clutched in the first two fingers of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who in the actual fuck is this lady and why is she at my parent&amp;#39;s house?&amp;quot; Kim wondered aloud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg glanced to his left to see John staring at the brunette, a confused look on his face. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know baby, but I&amp;#39;ll go find out what she wants. Maybe she knows your folks?&amp;quot; Greg doubted that he would like the answer to his own question when a faint chill slid down his spine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The tall brunette was taking a deep drag, both feet a fair distance apart, firmly planted on the ground, and didn&amp;#39;t break her staring contest with the clouds when Greg stepped from the vehicle and approached. He never took his eyes off her as he signalled John and Raven to stay in their car. Greg placed both hands on his daggers, stopping only five feet from the woman and her bike.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You won&amp;#39;t need those for me. I&amp;#39;m human, and not here to hurt you.&amp;quot; The woman spoke in a perfectly neutral accent. Each word exact, mundane, and direct. &amp;quot;We are on the same side, you four and I. Kim&amp;#39;s parents aren&amp;#39;t here. I need to speak with Raven.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg stood with his mouth half open, staring at the woman that still stared skyward. He had been about to speak when she had begun the exchange instead. Caught off guard by the quantity of information shoved into so few words, Greg closed his mouth to take a deep breath and smooth out his response. &amp;quot;How do you know this house, and how do you know Kim and Raven? Why should I believe anything you say?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who the fuck are you, lady?!&amp;quot; Kim yelled from her side of the suburban as she closed the passenger door and flung open the side door for Shadow to slink out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The large cat crept around Greg to flank the woman from her other side. When Shadow rounded out her flank, she stared up quizzically at the right side of the woman&amp;#39;s face. After a moment of silent regard, Shadow glanced between Greg, Kim, John and Raven in their car, and back to the brunette, then sat down on her haunches to continue studying the woman. Greg&amp;#39;s eyebrow went up when he realized the large feline had failed to garner a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The woman took a deep drag of her cigarette, cracked a small grin while she exhaled, and spoke to the sky once more. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll get her question out of the way first. I am Officer Silver. Katelyn Silver is my actual name, so it only sounds like my bosses like weird code names. You can all call me Kate. As for your questions, Gregory, I don&amp;#39;t personally know any of you. I have however been tasked with a mission concerning all of you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg glanced back at John and Raven, both of whom were still in Raven&amp;#39;s SUV. The confused look on Raven&amp;#39;s face told Greg everything he needed to know. &amp;quot;Well none of us know you, and we have our own things that we need to be seeing to, so have a good day and please get off this property.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate smirked, dropping her cigarette to the ground after a final drag. Finally looking away from the sky to glance at the ground as she stepped on her cigarette and twisted her heavy black combat boot to snuff the embers. Kate shifted without moving her feet to face Greg. He heard a squeak from Raven&amp;#39;s open window, and Kim brought forth fire, covering her right hand in a ball of swirling crimson flames. While Kate&amp;#39;s left eye was a striking blue, her right eye was what had drawn reactions. A silver orb with a dull blue light at its center sat where her natural born eye had once been. The eye&amp;#39;s blue light burned at Greg,  and he realized that Kate had a storm cloud growing behind her natural eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am sure you think to search this house yourself, but I assure you that it is quite empty. Now we only have five minutes for me to relay a message to Raven and get all four of you heading toward our objective.&amp;quot; Kate maintained her glare on Greg as she flung her hand up at Kim before she could start on a tirade. &amp;quot;My people are looking for your parents as we speak. Last report said that they were in Colorado. We&amp;#39;ll get them out too if you come with me and help us get ready. We&amp;#39;re on Enlightenment protocol, so I can freely answer any question I have the answers for later. For now, Raven&amp;#39;s dad demanded that we ensure her safe conduct to The Bastion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg&amp;#39;s eyes nearly fell from his head as he stared at the tall, imposing woman and tried to put together the barrage of information. She was nearly as tall as he, putting her at couple inches over six feet tall. No one made a sound for several heartbeats until Greg swallowed hard and took a step toward Raven&amp;#39;s door. &amp;quot;Hand over the message and I&amp;#39;ll pass it to her, then.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very well. We are wasting time. We have less than four minutes to be away from here.&amp;quot; Kate underhand tossed a small flat black square with a silvery dome in the center to Greg, who delicately caught the device in both hands. He passed it to Raven and she looked at the black and silver metal in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh just put it on the dash and push down on the top. We Need To Go!&amp;quot; Kate told Raven, emphasizing the last words with impatient urgency.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raven glared at the woman before doing as she had been told, her hand returning to her lap to clamp her other. The device then clicked softly several times before the multitude of small dimples on the silvery dome hissed open. Several hair-thin rods extended out four inches from the device. Small metal plates extended out from each rod to reach out and connect to the neighboring rods. In seconds the device had become a miniature satellite dish wish a soft blue glow emanating from its rim. Tiny beams of light streamed up into the center, and a cascade of light motes drifted up in a swirl. A sphere formed and shimmered, rippling with a static reminiscent of early television models.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate had gotten out another cigarette while everyone was glued to the high-tech device booting up. Greg reached out a hand, silently requesting a smoke. Kim grunted softly when Kate handed one over, a small bull&amp;#39;s snort coming from her nose. Greg pretended not to notice, lighting up as the image of an older man coalesced from the blue light on Raven&amp;#39;s dash. Color seeped into the image as it smoothed out into a white-haired tightly kept military man. His name tag was a blur, the image resolution failing to clarify the individual letters. Five stars formed a circle on the outer end of the top of each shoulder, along with several other insignias Greg didn&amp;#39;t recognize. He knew the five circular stars meant that the man was a five-star general, and that meant he was one of the most powerful men in the country, if not the world.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raven&amp;#39;s eyes glittered weekly with tears, a hand covering her shocked expression. &amp;quot;Pops?&amp;quot; She asked quietly, a tear sliding down her cheek as the image fully resolved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man&amp;#39;s hologram rubbed his throat, reached down out of view of the holo, and began to speak in a gruff baritone. &amp;quot;Raven, I need you to go with Katelyn. I&amp;#39;m told you four are very short on time and need to be on the move. Tell Kate to inform Kim and Greg that their parents locations have been confirmed and they will be safe soon. We know you have questions, but there is no time for answering them right now. Kate is one of my best; she will keep you safe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raven took in a slow, deep breath before sighing out a soft, &amp;quot;Yes, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my girl. Stay strong, and stay aware. You&amp;#39;re in more danger than you might know.&amp;quot; The man&amp;#39;s image shifted toward Greg before continuing. &amp;quot;Keep my little girl safe, but make sure you all make it out to The Bastion.&amp;quot; The general turned to Kate then, &amp;quot;Get going, officer. Stay safe, and godspeed.&amp;quot; With that, the general nodded to Raven with a faint smile and reached down out of sight once more. &amp;quot;I love you, little bird. I&amp;#39;ll see you soon,&amp;quot; he said before the communication was cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, well then, uh.. I think I&amp;#39;m convinced. What now?&amp;quot; Greg said, offering a shocked Kim a shrug and a shy grin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck it, I&amp;#39;m sold. My parents would have come out here by now- the house would have alerted them to our being out here. Where the fuck is this bastion?&amp;quot; Kim directed the last toward Kate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate&amp;#39;s head whipped around to look toward the drive on the other side of the garages, took three long, powerful strides to her motorcycle, flipping open one of the saddle-bags. Several small black drones darted out, racing high into the air before circling out in a five mote spiral. &amp;quot;Heat signatures detected on all sides. Five groups of six to ten un-identifieds. Closest is one-hundred and twenty eight yards out and coming up the drive. We took too long.&amp;quot; Two black cubes appeared in her hands and she tossed one to Raven and the other to Kim. &amp;quot;Communicators. The Bastion is a secure location to the west. I will not say more in as unsecure an environment as we are in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Several sharp whistling sounds came from five separate directions at the same time as Kate turned her engine over. &amp;quot;The darter drones are luring away our uninvited guests. Mount up and stay close! Greg and Kim, take the rear. John- keep that thing ten feet off my ass. Let&amp;#39;s Move!&amp;quot; Kate gave such strong orders that Greg found himself obeying immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shadow leapt from the side wall and slipped into the packed interior. Kim grunted irritably, closing the side door and hopping into the passenger seat once more. Greg heard the electric motor of Raven&amp;#39;s sleek SUV spin up the moment before he started his own. Kate lead John in a tight circle, turning toward the entry road without rounding the corner of the massive garage. Greg followed suit, but in the small rear parking area he only had enough room to get near to being in line without actually lining up straight. A dark howl reverberated off of the windows of the house and through their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate&amp;#39;s raised left hand was held in a fist until a howl sounded again from another direction. Her hand formed a knife that slashed forward and straight out. Her other hand cranked the motorcycle&amp;#39;s throttle, launching her forward. John accelerated hard in an attempt to stay close, while Greg too floored the accelerator and tore away from the empty mansion. Greg heard several enraged howls from behind and beside them as they topped the main hill and began to weave down the slope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shadow began to growl from her cubby beneath the supplies, her tail thumping as it lashed the bottom and sides of the containers. Greg saw small black objects taking flight from the saddle-bags once again as Kate lead the procession, obviously holding back on her throttle to keep close to the vehicles. The drones darted out in all directions, with four streaking for the road outside of Kim&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s property. Tires squealed as the two heavily burdened SUVs tore around the final curve of driveway and made for the main gate. The gate hung open limply, one of the drones perched atop the control box, which spat out sparks and smoke. Kate turned right onto the street before skidding her rear tire around her front in a dangerous, and loud, turn-about maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The small communicator crackled to life in Kim&amp;#39;s jacket pocket. &amp;quot;LEFT! NOW!&amp;quot; Kate&amp;#39;s voice was urgent, and she thrust her hand toward the ordered direction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;John accelerated hard onto the open street, scattering random plant and tree debris as the car lurched crazily for a moment before leveling out. Greg followed suit, fishtailing heavily as the suburban&amp;#39;s heavy rear and contents shifted the vehicle to nearly perpendicular to the street. Greg heaved on the wheel and swung the rear back around before finally getting the vehicle straightened out and straining up the neighborhood street. Kate&amp;#39;s motorcycle roared by on the passenger side, and Greg saw a massive pistol gripped in her gloved left hand. A moment later an explosion came from several hundred feet behind them on the street leading to the property they had just abandoned.  The large column of fire was visible in the side view mirrors for the seconds before they crested the current hill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another explosion ripped through the woods on their left, prompting more howling. Greg could see the light from the blast and felt the car vibrate from the shockwave. Two heartbeats and two explosions later they were careening around a corner and onto the main road of the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A slick black sports car swerved to avoid Kate as she flew out of the side street. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t brake!&amp;quot; She ordered as she swerved into oncoming traffic, causing several vehicles to slam on their brakes and creating a gap in the light traffic for John and Greg to enter the street at speed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg took a deep, nerve filled breath and exhaled slowly before chuckling nervously and glancing at Kim. &amp;quot;I think she might know what she&amp;#39;s doing, hun. This is goi-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg cut his words off, his jaw snapping shut with a click. He saw a massive quadrupedal figure burst from the woods a hundred yards ahead, clearing the twelve foot security fence to the richest neighborhood in the area to land directly on an old sedan. The car crumpled and shattered as several massive spikes punched through roof, trunk, hood, and the street around it. The towering figure looked like a cross between wolf, rhinoceros and bramble patch. The four powerful legs had spikes protruding from each armor plated segment as well as the three joints on each leg. Instead of feet it looked to have several spiked appendages. The armored head looked like the spiked end of a medieval mace, spikes jutting out one, two, or even three feet in most directions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sharp angle of the beastly muzzle reminded Greg of a bird of prey until it opened wide to reveal hundreds of jagged black teeth. The massive jaws ripped open the vehicle it had landed on, ripping its driver in half. Cars crashed and came to swerving halts before the beast, and sped away in horror beyond it, the beast roared while dozens of hellhounds tore through the fence and onto the street. Two drones sped from Kate&amp;#39;s bike, one impacting the large beast as the other slammed into the iron fence. Two massive explosions tore through the area, now only twenty yards away from Greg. Kate was nearly beyond them and John was close behind her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The beast roared, rounding angry more than hurt, and several hellhounds stumbled into the street, shaking their heads and stamping clawed feet. One sprinted into the street and lunged across the median at John and Raven&amp;#39;s vehicle. John swerved, almost managing to avoid the savage claws as one set of claws latched onto the very rear of the car&amp;#39;s left side. The hellhound skidded and bounced as John tried to dislodge the beast with erratic driving. Greg swerved too and kept the accelerator floored.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The massive spiked beast lumbered forward, dragging the crushed car for several yards before it dislodged, tearing away in a shriek of rending metal. Greg swerved to the opposite side of the street, managing to avoid the massive spiked arm that broke the street where they would have been.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The hellhound that had latched one claw onto Raven&amp;#39;s SUV began to pull itself up, getting a second clawed hand into the vehicle&amp;#39;s rear. John swerved hard, swinging around a vehicle at nearly seventy miles per hour and managed to clip the hellhound on the rear of the vehicle. The beast roared in anger at its lost grip on its prey even as it pinwheeled through the air several yards above the road.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg swerved to avoid a car on the opposite side of the street as he wove his way through the chaos and auto-cars and hellhounds. He saw the hellhound get swung out wide on the rear of the SUV, but another one leapt for him from the median. Kim grunted in effort and he saw the hellhound rocket higher into the air, clearing the top of the suburban by many feet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FUCK!&amp;quot; Kim shouted, drawing Greg&amp;#39;s attention back to their mad dash. She threw her hands out as Greg pulled the wheel and reflexively slammed the brakes in an effort to dodge the hellhound flying into their windshield. The beast had tumbled through the air to land perfectly on their hood the instant Greg had brought his attention forward again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The hood of the vehicle caved in heavily as the beast rolled up it, slamming into the windshield in a spray of glass and flailing spiked and clawed appendages.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': \"  \\nMarshall, along with everyone on Katel, had heard stories of the *Starliner*. More of a city than a ship, the F.C. *Starliner* was humanity’s greatest engineering achievement. Stretching its ultra-reinforced steel hull more than five miles long and wide, the ship briefly turned day into night as it passed over planets. Due to the ship’s massive size, it was equipped with the largest hyper-speed drive ever constructed, which took over twenty-five years of work to complete. The ship was outfitted with the most sophisticated weapons system of its time. Billions upon billions of dollars were poured into turning Starliner into a fortress to last eons.    \\n  \\t\\n*Not that the Starliner ever needs weapons*, Marshall thought. The few pirates and scavengers foolish enough to challenge the might of the Federation were exterminated before they even were in the same system as *Starliner*. The ship was the most protected manmade asset in the known universe. It served the Federation in one simple, yet crucial, purpose: investigate the unknown. The ship traversed galaxies and beyond, in search of new life and resources. Whenever a new habitable planet or system was found, it was documented, and the *Starliner* and its entourage of Federation warships moved on. When intelligent life was found, a small dispatch of human soldiers and scientists was left behind to make the first contact, and the ship moved on.   \\n  \\nMarshall had never seen the *Starliner*, nor had anyone else on Katel. Katel, a class four agricultural planet with an atmosphere similar to earth, had been discovered well before the ship’s construction. Katel was mostly inhabited by a peaceful, albeit threatening-looking species known to humanity as the Golian. The Golian were vaguely humanoid, more so than most of the species in System 11. The average male Golian stood at the friendly height of approximately nine feet tall. When discovered by the first Federal Rangers in 2112 A.D., the Golian were placed under the category of “extremely dangerous species.” It was soon discovered that, regardless of their size and intimidating bone structures, the Golian simply tended to their fields. Human translating devices soon picked up the Golian language, and amicable relations were made. Humanity didn’t stay on Katel for long, save for a few. The Golian gravity was 1.3x that of earth, and Katel’s sun beat down harshly. The Golian body had appropriately adapted. Thick, muscular legs propelled powered through tough gravity and efficient body coolant systems kept them from overheating. For the few humans remained on Katel, life was uncomfortable but bearable. \\n  \\nMarshall was one of those humans. Or, rather, his ancestors were. Marshall had no idea why his forefathers had chosen to stay on Katel, but he suspected they were lured by the simple agricultural life that Katel had to offer. The Golian were more than willing to share the land, and humanity offered up various technologies as thanks. Marshall had tilled his family’s small farm for years, ever since his parents had passed. He grew odd mixture of crops brought from earth and crops native to Katel. These days, Marshall preferred to only deal with produce that was earth-originated.  \\n   \\n*Prefer not working with crops at all*, Marshall grimly thought. As Marshall stood on the crest of a lone hill looking over his family’s swaths of wheat, corn, barley, and more, he wished for the Federation to return. The Federation hadn’t visited Katel in over fifty years, far before Marshall was born. For all of the domestic bliss Katel could offer, the planet was lacking in one resource Marshall desired: starships. More specifically, those with a warp drive. Ever since Marshall had gotten his hands on the controls of his father’s clipper, nothing had held his interest quite like space travel. Of course, the Golian used short-range cargo freights to carry tradable goods from planet to planet, but system-to-system travel was out of the question. The technology simply wasn’t on Katel. The Federation, however, was always on the lookout for new pilots, whether that be for combat, exploration, cargo, or any number of tasks an intergalactic bureaucracy found itself burdened with. Unfortunately for Marshall, the Federation seemingly never searched for those pilots on Katel. The government could hardly be blamed; the planet wasn’t ripe for potential candidates to begin with. Despite the inclinations of his ancestors, Marshall was not content with life “on the land.” \\n  \\nMarshall saw movement flicker in the corner of his eye and turned his gaze to the sky. Three moons bright enough to be seen in the daytime dominated the sky, along with Katel’s sun, but they weren’t important to Marshall. A grin stretched across Marshall’s face as he realized the movement hadn’t been avian -- it was a ship. \\n  \\nThe mid-sized cruiser began its descent. Twin engines mounted to the side of a shining hull burned bright as they stabilized the spacecraft. Decals depicting half-naked human women decorated the hull, and gaudy LED lights flashed in all colors, inviting anyone in a mile radius to take a look. The man sitting inside laid on the self-installed horn, forcing Marshall to cover his ears. Berwin had never been one for subtlety. The craft landed, and Marshall could see the name of the ship marked in bright lettering: *Arrowhead*. \\n  \\nThere was an incredible *WHOOOOSH* as the cockpit opened, and Berwin climbed out. \\n    \\n“You son of a bitch, I didn’t think I’d see you for another month,” Marshall said, extending his hand. The other man took it and pulled Marshall in for an embrace.  \\n   \\n“Thought I’d surprise you! Wouldn’t want you getting too cooped up here,” Berwin’s voice rang out clear and deep. He took a moment to brush any dust out of his long overcoat. Marshall wondered to himself how long the big man would be able to bear the heat in a coat like that -- especially a black one. The coat tumbled down to his knees, which were covered by a pair of torn blue jeans. Combined with his full beard, the outfit was better suited for the freezing winds of Westfar than the brutal heat of Katel. Berwin appeared to be regretting his fashion choice. His round face gleamed with sweat that he wiped away with a cloth handkerchief stored in the lining of his jacket.  \\n   \\n“I found some more parts,” Berwin suddenly spouted. “Nothing that’ll get you too far, but it might help get that piece of junk of yours off the ground.”  \\n   \\n“At this point, I’ll take anything,” responded Marshall. Sitting outside of Marshall’s house was the bones of an old two-man clipper, which Marshall had bought from a Golian who had intended to scrap it. In its prime, the *Direct* would have rivaled the speeds of most racers. These days, the ship was nothing more than a hunk of metal and dead electronics. Most notably, the ship was lacking a core. Fusion cores, required for interplanetary travel, were hard to come by on a planet like Katel. For months, Marshall had been slowly restoring what he could of the vessel. Progress was slow. Marshall learned what he could from various books and Federation resources, but he desperately needed parts. Berwin, when he visited, brought whatever he could, but the trading business rarely brings one to Katel. Regardless, Berwin was here now. He gestured Marshall to take a look inside the storage compartment of his ship.  \\n   \\nAs Berwin opened the hatch, Marshall’s jaw dropped.   \\n  \\n“Wow,” he whispered. The compartment of the ship wasn’t large, but Berwin had made good use of his space. Pristine stabilizing fins were propped along the sides of the compartment, and fresh coolant coils were strewn along the bottom. A large, lead-lined barrel of plutonium was strapped tightly to the back of the cushy pilot’s chair. Marshall’s eyes, however, snapped to a covered lump that took up the majority of the cabin.  \\n   \\n“What’s that?”  \\n  \\nBerwin flashed a dry grin and took hold of the tarp. As he tore the cloth away, Marshall couldn’t help but smile himself. A fusion core sat there, gloriously, inviting Marshall.\\n     \\n“Where the hell did you get this?” Marshall crouched to inspect the gleaming finish of the core. “This is new. There’s no way you found this just lying around.”  \\n   \\n“You like it?” Berwin beamed. “I called in a couple of favors from an Azil I met years ago who owed me for a few things. He just so happens to be the manager of a certain TourTech manufacturing plant. Things go missing all the time in places like those.” Marshall reached for the core, but hesitated. “Go for it,” Berwin said. “It’s yours.” \\n   \\nMarshall’s hands didn’t move, but his hazel eyes met Berwin’s. “I can’t take this, Far, you know that. This is worth thousands of credits, and you could sell it for more.” \\n   \\nBerwin shrugged. “Consider it an early birthday present for whenever your birthday is. I don’t need it and nobody’s gonna get better use out of it than you. It’s got warp capability, but I couldn’t get you a warp drive.”   \\n  \\nMarshall stood up and pulled Berwin into another embrace.   \\n  \\nIn the following months, Marshall devoted every second of his free time to the *Direct*. Even after a day of harvesting, he toiled outside, working on the ship as his black hair dripped with sweat. The hot Katel sun beat down relentlessly on Marshall, but he pressed on. As the days passed, rusty plates of metal were cleaned or scrapped, shot coils were replaced, and hovering gear was fixed. The starship began to look, but more importantly, *feel*, like a starship. Berwin came and went, bringing other small accessories. Excluding the core, the only other part of importance was a brand-new canopy, capable of sealing both heat and oxygen to the cockpit. \\n    \\nThe ship was almost complete. Only the new core was left to be installed, and Marshall had decided to wait for Berwin. In the meantime, Marshall continued to till his lands. He had more than enough credits saved to leave Katel and sustain himself for months, if not years, but he needed something to keep him occupied.  \\n   \\nOn a particularly hot and dry day, Berwin returned. Marshall waved him down and excitedly showed him all of the progress that had made on the *Direct*. The starship was almost ready for flight. Not all of it looked pretty, and rust and scratches still marred the otherwise structurally sound metal, but it was close. The two friends lugged the core onto the ship, and work began. Marshall did most of the technical work, which, at this point, was routine. All of the vastly complex parts lay within the core -- hooking it up was doable, albeit tedious. The first civilian fusion cores were designed to somewhat resemble a high-tech automobile engine, for marketing purposes. The fusion core ran off of plutonium or other highly radioactive materials rather than the solar panels that powered Marshall’s various farming machinery. Federation warships and other large vessels were powered by multiple fusion cores linked together through industrial-strength carbon pipes. Of course, those ships were capable of warping, unlike Marshall’s.  \\n   \\n As far as Marshall knew, humanity was the first species to successfully build a fusion core, giving them a head start to explore the universe. Humanity slowly expanded onto any habitable planets in the Milky Way and was surprised how close life had been to earth. The first living creatures humanity had found were microbes, simple bacteria on a planet three light-years from earth. Those microbes were more than enough to fuel the flame of human curiosity. The race to find intelligent life had begun in full force, and humanity didn’t have to wait long. The Droning, a small, insect-like race named for the sound of their quick wings, was found on a planet just six parsecs from the earth. The Droning had been more technologically advanced than humanity had anticipated, living in the equivalent of humanity’s stone age. \\n   \\nEven after more and more life was discovered, there had been one pressing issue facing humanity: time. Even at light-speed travel with fusion cores, getting from planet to planet had taken ludicrous amounts of time. Scientists couldn’t figure out how to break the lightspeed barrier. At least, until the Federation created the first warp drive. To get around this universal speed limit, the warp drive, rather than attempting to break the speed of light, simply shortened the distance between objects. By tearing a small hole in spacetime, a ship could briefly warp reality at a centralized location and phase back in at any desired location. Suddenly, distances no man could have traveled in a lifetime were just months, days, or hours away. Humanity’s arm, championed by the Federation, reached further into the cosmos, obtaining almost limitless resources. \\n  \\n*Soon, I’ll be right up there with ‘em*, Marshall thought, as he finished connecting the final wires of the core. He opened the canopy, pulled himself up onto the torn leather of the pilot’s seat, and then flipped the ignition. \\n    \\n“Here goes nothing,” Marshall said to Berwin, sat close by on some grass. He gazed over the console, examining every button, switch, and knob. Light bulbs that would hopefully soon be blinking in various indicators dotted the console, dead. He flipped the ignition switch.   \\n  \\nThe Direct’s new engine, complete with a fusion core, roared to life. Berwin jumped to his feet and hollered in celebration, clapping his hands over his ears and shouted something lost in the sound of the ship’s system’s coming to life. Marshall threw his first in the air, smiling as he closed the canopy over himself. He felt his ears pop as the cabin pressurized. A heads up display soon appeared on the reinforced glass in front of him, detailing his oxygen levels, shield capacity, and fuel levels in flashing colors. Orange, blue, red, and practically every other color on the rainbow flashed as Marshall took a second to admire his handiwork. He breathed in the crisp, cool air that flowed over the coolant coils he had installed himself. Remembering Berwin, he flipped off the engine and vaulted himself down a few feet to meet his friend.  \\n   \\nMarshall extended his hand. “Man, this is all because of you. You know that, right?” He gestured to the *Direct*.   \\n  \\nBerwin flashed his trademark grin. “I’m not the one who put in the hours. This is your--” He let out a curt grunt as a blast of air slammed into him, knocking him to his knees. Marshall grabbed onto the steel bar designed for entering the cockpit and braced himself. Leaves and grass swirled around him, and his hair whipped violently around his head. Berwin’s long coat did the same as the wind grew stronger, more violent. Both men felt their ears pop as the air pressure around them plummeted.   \\n  \\n*BOOM*  \\n  \\nA thunderclap dominated the winds below, and the sun disappeared. Marshall yelled in pain as the sound crashed into his ears. His eyes attempted to readjust to the new relative darkness and scanned the sky. Where the sun should have been, only a dark shape hung in the air. It was impossible, but Marshall knew exactly what had come. His face slowly contorted into an odd look of awe. There was only one ship large enough to cast a shadow like this.  \\n   \\n“The *Starliner*,” Marshall whispered. As his eyes adjusted, he could see the vessel clearly. It was almost difficult to determine where the ship began and where it ended. The *Starliner* was roughly spherical, designed to house a small ecosystem.

       "     'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marshall, along with everyone on Katel, had heard stories of the &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt;. More of a city than a ship, the F.C. &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt; was humanity’s greatest engineering achievement. Stretching its ultra-reinforced steel hull more than five miles long and wide, the ship briefly turned day into night as it passed over planets. Due to the ship’s massive size, it was equipped with the largest hyper-speed drive ever constructed, which took over twenty-five years of work to complete. The ship was outfitted with the most sophisticated weapons system of its time. Billions upon billions of dollars were poured into turning Starliner into a fortress to last eons.    &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Not that the Starliner ever needs weapons&lt;/em&gt;, Marshall thought. The few pirates and scavengers foolish enough to challenge the might of the Federation were exterminated before they even were in the same system as &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt;. The ship was the most protected manmade asset in the known universe. It served the Federation in one simple, yet crucial, purpose: investigate the unknown. The ship traversed galaxies and beyond, in search of new life and resources. Whenever a new habitable planet or system was found, it was documented, and the &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt; and its entourage of Federation warships moved on. When intelligent life was found, a small dispatch of human soldiers and scientists was left behind to make the first contact, and the ship moved on.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall had never seen the &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt;, nor had anyone else on Katel. Katel, a class four agricultural planet with an atmosphere similar to earth, had been discovered well before the ship’s construction. Katel was mostly inhabited by a peaceful, albeit threatening-looking species known to humanity as the Golian. The Golian were vaguely humanoid, more so than most of the species in System 11. The average male Golian stood at the friendly height of approximately nine feet tall. When discovered by the first Federal Rangers in 2112 A.D., the Golian were placed under the category of “extremely dangerous species.” It was soon discovered that, regardless of their size and intimidating bone structures, the Golian simply tended to their fields. Human translating devices soon picked up the Golian language, and amicable relations were made. Humanity didn’t stay on Katel for long, save for a few. The Golian gravity was 1.3x that of earth, and Katel’s sun beat down harshly. The Golian body had appropriately adapted. Thick, muscular legs propelled powered through tough gravity and efficient body coolant systems kept them from overheating. For the few humans remained on Katel, life was uncomfortable but bearable. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall was one of those humans. Or, rather, his ancestors were. Marshall had no idea why his forefathers had chosen to stay on Katel, but he suspected they were lured by the simple agricultural life that Katel had to offer. The Golian were more than willing to share the land, and humanity offered up various technologies as thanks. Marshall had tilled his family’s small farm for years, ever since his parents had passed. He grew odd mixture of crops brought from earth and crops native to Katel. These days, Marshall preferred to only deal with produce that was earth-originated.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prefer not working with crops at all&lt;/em&gt;, Marshall grimly thought. As Marshall stood on the crest of a lone hill looking over his family’s swaths of wheat, corn, barley, and more, he wished for the Federation to return. The Federation hadn’t visited Katel in over fifty years, far before Marshall was born. For all of the domestic bliss Katel could offer, the planet was lacking in one resource Marshall desired: starships. More specifically, those with a warp drive. Ever since Marshall had gotten his hands on the controls of his father’s clipper, nothing had held his interest quite like space travel. Of course, the Golian used short-range cargo freights to carry tradable goods from planet to planet, but system-to-system travel was out of the question. The technology simply wasn’t on Katel. The Federation, however, was always on the lookout for new pilots, whether that be for combat, exploration, cargo, or any number of tasks an intergalactic bureaucracy found itself burdened with. Unfortunately for Marshall, the Federation seemingly never searched for those pilots on Katel. The government could hardly be blamed; the planet wasn’t ripe for potential candidates to begin with. Despite the inclinations of his ancestors, Marshall was not content with life “on the land.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall saw movement flicker in the corner of his eye and turned his gaze to the sky. Three moons bright enough to be seen in the daytime dominated the sky, along with Katel’s sun, but they weren’t important to Marshall. A grin stretched across Marshall’s face as he realized the movement hadn’t been avian -- it was a ship. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The mid-sized cruiser began its descent. Twin engines mounted to the side of a shining hull burned bright as they stabilized the spacecraft. Decals depicting half-naked human women decorated the hull, and gaudy LED lights flashed in all colors, inviting anyone in a mile radius to take a look. The man sitting inside laid on the self-installed horn, forcing Marshall to cover his ears. Berwin had never been one for subtlety. The craft landed, and Marshall could see the name of the ship marked in bright lettering: &lt;em&gt;Arrowhead&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was an incredible &lt;em&gt;WHOOOOSH&lt;/em&gt; as the cockpit opened, and Berwin climbed out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You son of a bitch, I didn’t think I’d see you for another month,” Marshall said, extending his hand. The other man took it and pulled Marshall in for an embrace.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thought I’d surprise you! Wouldn’t want you getting too cooped up here,” Berwin’s voice rang out clear and deep. He took a moment to brush any dust out of his long overcoat. Marshall wondered to himself how long the big man would be able to bear the heat in a coat like that -- especially a black one. The coat tumbled down to his knees, which were covered by a pair of torn blue jeans. Combined with his full beard, the outfit was better suited for the freezing winds of Westfar than the brutal heat of Katel. Berwin appeared to be regretting his fashion choice. His round face gleamed with sweat that he wiped away with a cloth handkerchief stored in the lining of his jacket.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I found some more parts,” Berwin suddenly spouted. “Nothing that’ll get you too far, but it might help get that piece of junk of yours off the ground.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“At this point, I’ll take anything,” responded Marshall. Sitting outside of Marshall’s house was the bones of an old two-man clipper, which Marshall had bought from a Golian who had intended to scrap it. In its prime, the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt; would have rivaled the speeds of most racers. These days, the ship was nothing more than a hunk of metal and dead electronics. Most notably, the ship was lacking a core. Fusion cores, required for interplanetary travel, were hard to come by on a planet like Katel. For months, Marshall had been slowly restoring what he could of the vessel. Progress was slow. Marshall learned what he could from various books and Federation resources, but he desperately needed parts. Berwin, when he visited, brought whatever he could, but the trading business rarely brings one to Katel. Regardless, Berwin was here now. He gestured Marshall to take a look inside the storage compartment of his ship.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As Berwin opened the hatch, Marshall’s jaw dropped.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wow,” he whispered. The compartment of the ship wasn’t large, but Berwin had made good use of his space. Pristine stabilizing fins were propped along the sides of the compartment, and fresh coolant coils were strewn along the bottom. A large, lead-lined barrel of plutonium was strapped tightly to the back of the cushy pilot’s chair. Marshall’s eyes, however, snapped to a covered lump that took up the majority of the cabin.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Berwin flashed a dry grin and took hold of the tarp. As he tore the cloth away, Marshall couldn’t help but smile himself. A fusion core sat there, gloriously, inviting Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Where the hell did you get this?” Marshall crouched to inspect the gleaming finish of the core. “This is new. There’s no way you found this just lying around.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You like it?” Berwin beamed. “I called in a couple of favors from an Azil I met years ago who owed me for a few things. He just so happens to be the manager of a certain TourTech manufacturing plant. Things go missing all the time in places like those.” Marshall reached for the core, but hesitated. “Go for it,” Berwin said. “It’s yours.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall’s hands didn’t move, but his hazel eyes met Berwin’s. “I can’t take this, Far, you know that. This is worth thousands of credits, and you could sell it for more.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Berwin shrugged. “Consider it an early birthday present for whenever your birthday is. I don’t need it and nobody’s gonna get better use out of it than you. It’s got warp capability, but I couldn’t get you a warp drive.”   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall stood up and pulled Berwin into another embrace.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the following months, Marshall devoted every second of his free time to the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt;. Even after a day of harvesting, he toiled outside, working on the ship as his black hair dripped with sweat. The hot Katel sun beat down relentlessly on Marshall, but he pressed on. As the days passed, rusty plates of metal were cleaned or scrapped, shot coils were replaced, and hovering gear was fixed. The starship began to look, but more importantly, &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, like a starship. Berwin came and went, bringing other small accessories. Excluding the core, the only other part of importance was a brand-new canopy, capable of sealing both heat and oxygen to the cockpit. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The ship was almost complete. Only the new core was left to be installed, and Marshall had decided to wait for Berwin. In the meantime, Marshall continued to till his lands. He had more than enough credits saved to leave Katel and sustain himself for months, if not years, but he needed something to keep him occupied.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On a particularly hot and dry day, Berwin returned. Marshall waved him down and excitedly showed him all of the progress that had made on the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt;. The starship was almost ready for flight. Not all of it looked pretty, and rust and scratches still marred the otherwise structurally sound metal, but it was close. The two friends lugged the core onto the ship, and work began. Marshall did most of the technical work, which, at this point, was routine. All of the vastly complex parts lay within the core -- hooking it up was doable, albeit tedious. The first civilian fusion cores were designed to somewhat resemble a high-tech automobile engine, for marketing purposes. The fusion core ran off of plutonium or other highly radioactive materials rather than the solar panels that powered Marshall’s various farming machinery. Federation warships and other large vessels were powered by multiple fusion cores linked together through industrial-strength carbon pipes. Of course, those ships were capable of warping, unlike Marshall’s.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As far as Marshall knew, humanity was the first species to successfully build a fusion core, giving them a head start to explore the universe. Humanity slowly expanded onto any habitable planets in the Milky Way and was surprised how close life had been to earth. The first living creatures humanity had found were microbes, simple bacteria on a planet three light-years from earth. Those microbes were more than enough to fuel the flame of human curiosity. The race to find intelligent life had begun in full force, and humanity didn’t have to wait long. The Droning, a small, insect-like race named for the sound of their quick wings, was found on a planet just six parsecs from the earth. The Droning had been more technologically advanced than humanity had anticipated, living in the equivalent of humanity’s stone age. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even after more and more life was discovered, there had been one pressing issue facing humanity: time. Even at light-speed travel with fusion cores, getting from planet to planet had taken ludicrous amounts of time. Scientists couldn’t figure out how to break the lightspeed barrier. At least, until the Federation created the first warp drive. To get around this universal speed limit, the warp drive, rather than attempting to break the speed of light, simply shortened the distance between objects. By tearing a small hole in spacetime, a ship could briefly warp reality at a centralized location and phase back in at any desired location. Suddenly, distances no man could have traveled in a lifetime were just months, days, or hours away. Humanity’s arm, championed by the Federation, reached further into the cosmos, obtaining almost limitless resources. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon, I’ll be right up there with ‘em&lt;/em&gt;, Marshall thought, as he finished connecting the final wires of the core. He opened the canopy, pulled himself up onto the torn leather of the pilot’s seat, and then flipped the ignition. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Here goes nothing,” Marshall said to Berwin, sat close by on some grass. He gazed over the console, examining every button, switch, and knob. Light bulbs that would hopefully soon be blinking in various indicators dotted the console, dead. He flipped the ignition switch.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Direct’s new engine, complete with a fusion core, roared to life. Berwin jumped to his feet and hollered in celebration, clapping his hands over his ears and shouted something lost in the sound of the ship’s system’s coming to life. Marshall threw his first in the air, smiling as he closed the canopy over himself. He felt his ears pop as the cabin pressurized. A heads up display soon appeared on the reinforced glass in front of him, detailing his oxygen levels, shield capacity, and fuel levels in flashing colors. Orange, blue, red, and practically every other color on the rainbow flashed as Marshall took a second to admire his handiwork. He breathed in the crisp, cool air that flowed over the coolant coils he had installed himself. Remembering Berwin, he flipped off the engine and vaulted himself down a few feet to meet his friend.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall extended his hand. “Man, this is all because of you. You know that, right?” He gestured to the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Berwin flashed his trademark grin. “I’m not the one who put in the hours. This is your--” He let out a curt grunt as a blast of air slammed into him, knocking him to his knees. Marshall grabbed onto the steel bar designed for entering the cockpit and braced himself. Leaves and grass swirled around him, and his hair whipped violently around his head. Berwin’s long coat did the same as the wind grew stronger, more violent. Both men felt their ears pop as the air pressure around them plummeted.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOOM&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A thunderclap dominated the winds below, and the sun disappeared. Marshall yelled in pain as the sound crashed into his ears. His eyes attempted to readjust to the new relative darkness and scanned the sky. Where the sun should have been, only a dark shape hung in the air. It was impossible, but Marshall knew exactly what had come. His face slowly contorted into an odd look of awe. There was only one ship large enough to cast a shadow like this.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt;,” Marshall whispered. As his eyes adjusted, he could see the vessel clearly. It was almost difficult to determine where the ship began and where it ended. The &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt; was roughly spherical, designed to house a small ecosystem. The hull was mainly constructed of reinforced steel that was meters thick and was designed to withstand any attack. However, the real defense came in the form of energy shields that coated every inch of the ship. When Marshall was a child, he once heard a rumor that the only time the ship had ever been directly struck by any long-range attack was during a Federation training exercise in which shields were intentionally dropped to practice evasive maneuvers. Looking at the ship in front of him, though, Marshall couldn’t imagine ever needing to flee from a fight. Starliner was the safest place in the galaxy in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s beautiful,” Berwin muttered, standing next to Marshall. “I never thought I’d see it with my own eyes.”   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In nature, the most beautiful flowers and creatures tend to be the most dangerous. On a small exoplanet just outside of Katel’s system, the most common native plant was a small red flower. Fields holding nothing but venenum pulchritudo stretched for miles in all directions. The flower, when first discovered, was regaled for its diminutive beauty. At the center of the flower was an exquisite and defining pattern of folded petals in the shape of a diamond. Unfortunately, a few unlucky Rangers decided to surprise their partners back on earth with a vase of the exotic and unique flower.

Not one but two new species had been discovered (by their own species no less), and whilst he had prepared raiding fleets for \"Human\" colonies given their small demeanour, lack of claws, and only two arms, the \"Oba\" colonies proved to be a better target given that their slug-like bodies make it particularly difficult to field weaponry. With those raids done with a few days prior, he was relaxing in his ambassador suite enjoying some recent spoils. As it turns out, they\\'re pretty good at making alcoholic beverages, possibly due to their biology.\\n\\nA notice appears on his desk. \"Hmm...\" barely escapes him, it\\'s a message from the Human ambassador, Tom Alberto.\\n\\n    [PERIOD 8 - MOMENT 343] Personal message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Gerno ambassador Lllarkerh Krando\\n    \\n    Larker,\\n    I would like to have a discussion before the coalition session you organised today.\\n    I have a feeling these two events are related.\\n    Meet me in my quarters at period 9.\\n    \\n    - Tom\\n\\n---\\n(following text is from Lllarkerh\\'s perspective)\\n\\nSeems like news travels fast, he must already know that I\\'m responsible for those raids.

May as well entertain the notion at least, see if I can\\'t avoid losing a few troops if I can help it.\\n\\nEager to put Humanity in their place I set out for his quarters, bringing my portable computer with me. Portability was just about the only thing they\\'ve managed to bring to the coalition, I\\'m sure it\\'ll help demonstrate that they will only serve to improve our own species, plus it\\'s a long walk and I could do with a distraction.\\n\\nAfter filling myself in on the news and speculation surrounding the raids I\\'ve conducted, I\\'ve found myself arriving a few moments early at the Human ambassador quarters. Curiously enough, there\\'s a chair opposite the door that seems designed just for me, considering that I\\'m twice their size. There\\'s also a variety of other chairs for the other species, one of which lacks a backrest, which I\\'ve decided to use as a footrest.\\n\\nAcross the hall I can see a couple Humans talking to each other, with the occasional glance in my direction. Not content to let myself be the target of some joke, I get up and head in their direction.  \\nH1: \"-it\\'s crazy, do they not look in the mirror or something?\"  \\nH2: \"They look like- oh, here he comes...\"  \\nL: \"What is it? Spit it out!\" I demand, approaching a half-shout.  \\nH2: \"Well, uh...um...\" They\\'re both visibly shocked by my outburst.  \\nH1: \"You look like, uh, a bear with scales.\"  \\nA bear with scales? Pulling up my portable computer, I investigate what this bear is, only to find it remarkably similar to myself except with fur and not scales.  \\nL: \"I suppose I do, and are bears ferocious predators?\"  \\nH2: \"You could say that.\"  \\nL: \"Excellent.\"\\n\\nSeems like I might have the upper hand in our discussion. As I\\'m heading back to my chair, Tom exits from his quarters looking at a device on his wrist.  \\nT: \"Ah, right on time. Come in.\"  \\nHis quarters seem to be laid out for our discussion. Two chairs opposite one another, one for each of us, around a large table about 5 metres in diameter, with a lot of chairs set out to the side, he must have larger discussions frequently. The table itself is rather strange, it\\'s a particularly thin table and appears to be made of polished iron. There\\'s also about 20 notepads laid out around the table, seems like they\\'re still quite primitive in some ways.  \\nT: \"I see you\\'re a fan of our tables. They\\'re not really my type but they make quite the impression, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree.\"  \\nPulling out my computer, a quick scan confirms my assumption. Iron, plus Chromium, and a little Carbon. Steel, not iron, which explains the thinness.\\n\\nAs we\\'re both taking our seats, I try to cut to the chase.  \\nL: \"Could we get to the point? The session is in a few cycles.\"  \\nT: \"Of course. I wish to avoid an unnecessary war.\"  \\nWar? Raids are commonplace, surely he can\\'t see this as declaration of war.  \\nL: \"We have no intention of going to war with the Oda.\"  \\nT: \"I wish to avoid *Humans* going to an unnecessary war *in defence of* the Oda.\"  \\nAh, pack mentality. I\\'ve seen it before, weak species banding together protecting one-another from predators.  \\nHe\\'s also quite blunt when he needs to be, I appreciate that. Too many ambassadors try to sneak out of subjects with words that lack real meaning. Reminds me of politicians.  \\nL: \"Perhaps you should concentrate on your own outposts before looking at those of another species? As I recall, you have yet to receive our...formal greeting.\"  \\nT: \"Are you planning on attacking our colonies?\"  \\nNow\\'s my chance, with an attack on his mind and the recent devastation of Oda outposts, maybe I can get a tribute instead of resorting to bloodshed.  \\nT: \"I would advise-\"  \\nAs he continues, I stand and slam both hands into his table. It makes a satisfying thunk that echoes in his quarters, taking several seconds to die out completely. However, Tom seems...unimpressed? Almost like I\\'m a child throwing a tantrum.\\n\\nRising to a shout, I set about breaking my foe verbally.  \\nL: \"Listen, and listen well. Once we\\'ve processed our \\'donation\\' from Oda, you\\'re next!\"  \\nTom slowly stands, not content to let it be a one-sided shouting contest.  \\nL: \"You\\'ll be fortunate to get off with just one outpost in the attack!\"  \\nIs he...rubbing the table?  \\nT: \"You pride yourself on physical strength, yes?\"  \\nHe\\'s strangely calm, almost too calm...  \\nL: \"We are the strongest species in the galaxy!\" I boast with pride.  \\nHe lets out a sigh, knowing his defeat.  \\nT: \"That\\'s a shame, I quite like this table.\"  \\nL: \"I do not care for your meaningless objects! You will pay tribute in one month or you will find-\"  \\nLifting one arm to near head level, he brings it down on his table with a shattering boom far outmatching my own. The table is visibly warped from the impact, and there\\'s a distinct hand-shaped dent a couple centimetres deep where he struck it.  \\nT: \"You are the *second* strongest species in the galaxy. You will return what you stole from the Oda.\" Calm, as always, despite the strike.  \\nL: \"Like hell we will! You can\\'t make demands of-\"  \\nHe strikes the table again, the table buckles further and the notepads laid out start sliding into the groove. A second hand-shaped dent remains in the table.\\n\\nI can\\'t back down. I won\\'t back down. This has to be a trick, he must have laid out the table specifically to have a weakened section in front of him, with the notepads added for effect. No advanced species would use such primitive tools in a place like this. Extending my claws, I set about scraping my side of the table, producing a satisfying screech as Tom recoils from the sound.  \\nSeeing how sheer strength and volume isn\\'t cutting it, I\\'ll have to go back to a more...diplomatic voice.  \\nL: \"You will pay tribute in one month. 3 million tonnes of iron, 1 mill-\"  \\nA third strike, this time with both hands, and the table breaks in two. Looking across the newly formed edge, it\\'s clear the table wasn\\'t tampered with, if anything the table looks thicker on his side. A sickly feeling creeps in as I realise I\\'m not the predator in this room, and for the first time my eyes catch his. I wish they never did.  \\nT: \"I will repeat my demands at the session.\"  \\nHis eyes bore into me, searching, probing, looking for more weakness. He has me, he knows he has me, and he knows I know.  \\nT: \"If you have any objections, feel free to voice them then. Get out.\"  \\nI try to think of a response, but nothing comes. He\\'s started to walk to my side of the table, running his fingers against the polished surface of this half of the table, producing an unsettling rubbing sound. He stops a couple metres away, staring straight at me, eyes full of fury despite the calm demeanour.  \\nBarely maintaining composure, I give a quick \"Very well.\" and head out. I need to get back to my quarters, a ground invasion probably isn\\'t the best course of action right now. I also need more alcohol.\\n\\n    [PERIOD 9 - MOMENT 11] Message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Human engineering\\n    \\n    Gene,\\n    I could do with another table.\\n    \\n    - Tom\\n-\\n    [PERIOD 9 - MOMENT 15] Message from Human engineering to Human ambassador Tom Alberto\\n    \\n    Again?

The downside is that it only outlines places and corridors I\\'ve been to, but at the same time, it does allow me to keep track of my route.\\n\\nSadly, the last two months were for nothing. I found several divine artifacts, but they were worthless. Amelia has grown stronger during all that time, while my gains were sparse.\\n\\nKeeping in contact with Hero City is easy enough. I can say \\'Call,\\' and speak to Phoebe, Neil, or anyone else as needed.\\n\\nDespite suffering some setbacks, I\\'m surprised at how smoothly things have gone. I ran into a Demon Lord, Beelzebub, but the guy was such a pushover that now I\\'m worried I may be the single person who stands between Amelia planet-level hunger. I\\'ve only faced Lords up to now, while Amelia defeated three Dukes at the same time. \\n\\nIf I can\\'t stop her, I don\\'t see how anyone can.\\n\\nSlowing down, I wipe my forehead, realizing I\\'m feeling quite tired. \"**Water.**\"\\n\\nA jug of icy cold water pops into existence before me, and I plop down for a moment to catch my breath. The liquid of the gods tastes incredible when I\\'m running around in the Labyrinth. Something about the ambient temperature here is always just a little too warm to be comfortable. I can cool myself down with Wordsmithing, but that unpleasant heat always comes creeping back.\\n\\nAnd of course, thinking about the heat gets me wondering about other things too. What produces oxygen in the Labyrinth? I know plants exist, but they\\'re all in the upper and outer sections.\\n\\n\"**Pizza,**\" I say, giving myself a slice of pepperoni deep-dish with stuffed crust. Mmm. Pizza on Earth never tasted so perfect. It\\'s cooked exactly the way I like.\\n\\nAs I chow on the food, a thought occurs to me. _It\\'s funny how I can use my internal spiritual energy to create food, water, and external sources of power. Then when I rest at night, my spiritual energy completely refills._\\n\\nThe more I think about them, the more I realize how utterly broken my abilities are. If I keep experimenting, I\\'m sure to find new ways to use my Wordsmithing.\\n\\nAfter drinking my fill, I jump to my feet and Wordsmith again. \"**Vaporize.**\" The jug of water vanishes from existence, leaving no trace behind for anyone to find. Gotta cover my tracks.\\n\\nI\\'ve been reflecting on Amelia a lot, lately. I haven\\'t stopped thinking about how I can put an end to her inhuman rampage since I left the Core. What if I vaporized her with my Wordsmithing? I could kill her, just like that. I could do the same to all the demons.\\n\\nBut... should I? Is it right for me to pass judgment on others?\\n\\nMy power is abnormal. It\\'s not something that should exist. Godlike, incredible potential shouldn\\'t be in the hands of any random human. So why do I have it? Was I chosen for a reason? Am I somehow superior to everyone else? What about Einstein? Wouldn\\'t he have made better use of Wordsmithing if God had given him the ability?\\n\\nNo. It\\'s random luck that I was the one bestowed with Wordsmithing. I may be a Hero, the descendant of mythical warriors, but I don\\'t consider myself legendary. I might be the last hope for humanity, but I feel like a child playing with a gun. My ability is a dangerous thing, something that might backfire and hurt the people I love.\\n\\nMy footsteps echo off the walls as I start walking down the corridor again.\\n\\n_I wonder if Phoebe thinks about me when she sleeps,_ my mind wanders. _I know I like to dream about her, though I can\\'t sleep in the wilds of the Labyrinth._\\n\\nIndeed, over the past two months, I\\'ve not slept even one time, instead choosing to use my slowly depleting mana reserves to keep myself awake. I don\\'t feel any aftereffects, so it must be working, but I can\\'t keep it up forever. Sooner or later I\\'ll need to catch a catnap and hope the demons don\\'t-\\n\\n_What was that?_\\n\\nA noise behind me makes me stop and listen. _Is that... clicking?_\\n\\nMoments pass. Nothing. Neither my sonar nor my infrared vision show any blips.\\n\\nGod, I\\'m getting jumpy. Maybe I should take a nap after all.\\n\\nA chill goes down my back as I continue walking. There\\'s nobody around, but I feel naked and defenseless. An eye watches me.\\n\\nOne or two minutes pass. The feeling intensifies. A sensation like a finger presses against my back, and I immediately jump forward and spin around. \"Who\\'s there?!\"\\n\\nA male voice replies. \"Ksss, I was carelesss.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t see any part of the man at all. There\\'s no heat, and he doesn\\'t show up in a way that my sonar can detect. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve found you, flessshbag. Your glowing eyesss are quite remarkable. I look forward to adding them to my collection.\"\\n\\n\"What... what the hell are you? A ghost?!\"\\n\\n\"Sssomething like that. I am Mephisssto, Duke of Missst. A pleasssure to make your acquaintance, keh keh keh.\" Mephisto coughs like a chain-smoker. I can only assume he\\'s laughing. \"It ssseemsss you\\'re having trouble ssseeing me. Looksss like thossse eyesss are jussst for ssshow.\"\\n\\nMy heart pounds in my chest. This... _thing_... is a Duke? It has an entirely different presence from that Beelzebub fellow. The killing intent ripples from it and spills around, creating a sense of dread in the back of my mind.\\n\\nWhile the Duke of Mist hisses and titters to himself, I quickly jerk my hand out. My Lightsaber flies off my belt, lands in my palm, and ignites. My backpack\\'s cord attachment snaps onto the lightsaber, and I swing wildly in front of me, trying to hit whoever the hell this new guy is. My slashes cut into the walls on either side, slicing out paths of molten dirt and stone wherever my weapon strikes.\\n\\nI jump back and stare silently, but I can\\'t tell if my attacks had any effect.\\n\\n\"Oh no, you got me,\" The Duke of Mist says, a mocking tone in his voice. \"Ohh, the pain. It hurtsss, I\\'m dyiiing.\" He drags the last syllable out, cranking his sarcasm meter to max levels.\\n\\nWhile Mephisto laughs to himself, I send out a wave of telekinetic energy, yanking rocks from the ceiling down and onto where I think he\\'s standing.\\n\\n_Crash! Crash!_\\n\\nThe ceiling collapses on Mephisto\\'s position, only for the Duke to laugh even more uproariously.\\n\\n\"Keh keh keh! Good effort, flessshbag. Ssstill, perhapsss Beelzebub wasss telling the truth. You appear to be a Hero, after all.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t hurt you? Not even a little bit?!\"\\n\\n\"You may attempt to ssstrike me if you pleassse, but...\" The Duke pauses for dramatic effect. \"Allow me to ssshow you how it\\'sss done.\"\\n\\nSuddenly, from the point on my back that I felt his touch a minute ago, a violent pain erupts, sending me sprawling to the floor, my lightsaber just barely missing my face by inches. Agony jolts up my spine in waves, as if currents of electricity are coursing through my internal organs.\\n\\n\"Gaahg! Hnnngh! Fuck! Shiiit!\"\\n\\nI nearly bite off my tongue as my body reflexively curls into the fetal position. I can\\'t make the pain stop at all! \\n\\nAfter a few moments of writhing, I blink back tears and remember my Wordsmithing. \"**N-Neutralize! Heal!**\"\\n\\nThe pain stops. I freeze and shiver on the ground for half a minute as nausea roils around in my stomach. Using my telekinesis, I deactivate my lightsaber so that I don\\'t kill myself by accident.\\n\\n\"Sssussspiciousss.\" Mephisto\\'s voice holds a note of caution. \"Ssstopping my Pain Inducement without making hand sssignsss... very unusssual.\"\\n\\nWith a force of will that makes my head spin, I leap to my feet and quickly dash away. _Jesus Christ! Mephisto isn\\'t fucking around! I can\\'t see him, and I can\\'t hurt him either!_\\n\\nScarcely have I made it fifty feet, when Mephisto\\'s voice appears in front of me, making me screech to a halt. \"Foul flessshbag! I wassn\\'t done ssspeaking! Ssshow ressspect to your new massster!\"\\n\\n\"Fuck that!\" I yell and wonder how the hell he got in front of me. \"**Wall!**\"\\n\\nThe entire Labyrinth shakes as a foot-thick barrier forms between us in less than a second, and I quickly rush back in the direction I just left. I don\\'t want to head back toward Beelzebub, but maybe if I put some distance between myself and Mephisto, there will be a side tunnel or two that-\\n\\n\"Insssolent human!\"\\n\\nMephisto\\'s voice appears in front of me yet again, making me scream in fright and stumble backward, landing on my ass. _This Duke can move through walls?! Who the fuck am I dealing with?!_\\n\\nBefore I can get up and run away, an iron fist pounds me in the chest. It knocks the wind out of me and sends me tumbling back head over heels.\\n\\nMy vision spins. The nausea from a few moments ago reappears in violent form, and I vomit all over, only to realize I\\'m on my back. The bile erupts and lands all over my face, neck, and chest.\\n\\n\"Kuh-clean! **Clean!**\" I belch the words out, and the vomit disappears, leaving me feeling minty fresh, yet still horribly sickened.\\n\\nI can\\'t see him. I can\\'t sense him. He\\'s a goddamn ghost, able to move faster than me and pass through walls. Compared to Beelzebub\\'s little fire-show, this Duke is unspeakably dangerous. Forget Amelia! If I can\\'t beat the Duke of Mist, I\\'m done for!\\n\\nA familiar sound catches my attention. Clicking. The sound I heard before. Staggering to my feet, my jaw drops as a massive wall of skeletons shambles toward me. These aren\\'t like the weak little buggers Beelzebub controlled. Their intricately shaped armor, enormous steel shields, and swords all speak to a level of power I haven\\'t seen before.\\n\\nEven so, skeletons usually wouldn\\'t be a problem, but with Mephisto lurking around, I can\\'t afford to treat them lightly. They\\'ll distract me while he circles around and jams a knife into my back.\\n\\n\"Keh keh keh... do you like my creationsss? I am the massster of Death in the Labyrinth.\" Mephisto\\'s voice is still a little ways away. He must have punched me and stayed in his spot. \"Reanimation isss trivial for one asss powerful asss I. The other Dukesss don\\'t underssstand the ssskill and danger involved in reanimation, but sssoon they will.\"\\n\\nMy breath comes in gasps. I need to escape, but the Duke of Mist moves faster than me. I can\\'t hurt him with ordinary attacks, nor can I slow him down with barriers.\\n\\n_Think, Jason, think!_\\n\\nI can\\'t. My head is still spinning from that spinal attack. I\\'m out of breath, exhausted, and facing a Demon Duke; one of the most powerful beings in the Labyrinth.\\n\\n_Amelia beat him in combat?!_\\n\\nYes, that\\'s right. She killed that Agares fellow, but Mephisto was one of the other two Dukes that were there. If the Scyther brothers weren\\'t lying, then that means he managed to escape unscathed. Perhaps Amelia couldn\\'t hurt him.\\n\\nFUCK!\\n\\nHow do I get out of this situation?!\\n\\nAn idea appears. _It\\'s worth a shot!_\\n\\n\"**Speed! Speed! Power! Power! Perception!**\"\\n\\nIf the Duke of Mist is fast, then I have to be faster!\\n\\nSpinning on my heel, I dash away, racing toward the fake wall I created. Unlike last time when I was with Amelia and I hyper-speed-dashed into the Great Doors of the Labyrinth Core, this time, my mind manages to keep up with the speed increase.\\n\\nI pound through the fake wall without stopping, rushing with all my might, occasionally yelling \"**Heal!**\" whenever the power threatens to tear my limbs apart.\\n\\nMinutes pass. I continue tearing down the Labyrinth halls at speeds approaching a hundred miles an hour. Left, right, through this path and that, I ignore my heart screaming in pain. Ultimately, I can\\'t maintain my mad dash and slow to a stop. My body aches as if death is moments away.\\n\\nGasping for breath, I speak again, \"**Normalize,**\" returning my body to its original state.\\n\\n\"**Wa... Water.**\"\\n\\nAs the jug of icy water appears in my hand, I lift it to take a drink.\\n\\nA voice whispers in my ear.\\n\\n\"Oopsss, you almossst lossst me.\"\\n\\n**[Next Part](https://reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dl41hl/the_cryopod_to_hell_033_stab_and_seek/?)**',\n",

There&amp;#39;s no heat, and he doesn&amp;#39;t show up in a way that my sonar can detect. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve found you, flessshbag. Your glowing eyesss are quite remarkable. I look forward to adding them to my collection.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What... what the hell are you? A ghost?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sssomething like that. I am Mephisssto, Duke of Missst. A pleasssure to make your acquaintance, keh keh keh.&amp;quot; Mephisto coughs like a chain-smoker. I can only assume he&amp;#39;s laughing. &amp;quot;It ssseemsss you&amp;#39;re having trouble ssseeing me. Looksss like thossse eyesss are jussst for ssshow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart pounds in my chest. This... &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;... is a Duke? It has an entirely different presence from that Beelzebub fellow. The killing intent ripples from it and spills around, creating a sense of dread in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While the Duke of Mist hisses and titters to himself, I quickly jerk my hand out. My Lightsaber flies off my belt, lands in my palm, and ignites. My backpack&amp;#39;s cord attachment snaps onto the lightsaber, and I swing wildly in front of me, trying to hit whoever the hell this new guy is. My slashes cut into the walls on either side, slicing out paths of molten dirt and stone wherever my weapon strikes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I jump back and stare silently, but I can&amp;#39;t tell if my attacks had any effect.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no, you got me,&amp;quot; The Duke of Mist says, a mocking tone in his voice. &amp;quot;Ohh, the pain. It hurtsss, I&amp;#39;m dyiiing.&amp;quot; He drags the last syllable out, cranking his sarcasm meter to max levels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While Mephisto laughs to himself, I send out a wave of telekinetic energy, yanking rocks from the ceiling down and onto where I think he&amp;#39;s standing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash! Crash!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The ceiling collapses on Mephisto&amp;#39;s position, only for the Duke to laugh even more uproariously.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keh keh keh! Good effort, flessshbag. Ssstill, perhapsss Beelzebub wasss telling the truth. You appear to be a Hero, after all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t hurt you? Not even a little bit?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may attempt to ssstrike me if you pleassse, but...&amp;quot; The Duke pauses for dramatic effect. &amp;quot;Allow me to ssshow you how it&amp;#39;sss done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, from the point on my back that I felt his touch a minute ago, a violent pain erupts, sending me sprawling to the floor, my lightsaber just barely missing my face by inches. Agony jolts up my spine in waves, as if currents of electricity are coursing through my internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gaahg! Hnnngh! Fuck! Shiiit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nearly bite off my tongue as my body reflexively curls into the fetal position. I can&amp;#39;t make the pain stop at all! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a few moments of writhing, I blink back tears and remember my Wordsmithing. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;N-Neutralize! Heal!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The pain stops. I freeze and shiver on the ground for half a minute as nausea roils around in my stomach. Using my telekinesis, I deactivate my lightsaber so that I don&amp;#39;t kill myself by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sssussspiciousss.&amp;quot; Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice holds a note of caution. &amp;quot;Ssstopping my Pain Inducement without making hand sssignsss... very unusssual.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With a force of will that makes my head spin, I leap to my feet and quickly dash away. &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ! Mephisto isn&amp;#39;t fucking around! I can&amp;#39;t see him, and I can&amp;#39;t hurt him either!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scarcely have I made it fifty feet, when Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice appears in front of me, making me screech to a halt. &amp;quot;Foul flessshbag! I wassn&amp;#39;t done ssspeaking! Ssshow ressspect to your new massster!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck that!&amp;quot; I yell and wonder how the hell he got in front of me. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Wall!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The entire Labyrinth shakes as a foot-thick barrier forms between us in less than a second, and I quickly rush back in the direction I just left. I don&amp;#39;t want to head back toward Beelzebub, but maybe if I put some distance between myself and Mephisto, there will be a side tunnel or two that-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Insssolent human!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice appears in front of me yet again, making me scream in fright and stumble backward, landing on my ass. &lt;em&gt;This Duke can move through walls?! Who the fuck am I dealing with?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I can get up and run away, an iron fist pounds me in the chest. It knocks the wind out of me and sends me tumbling back head over heels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My vision spins. The nausea from a few moments ago reappears in violent form, and I vomit all over, only to realize I&amp;#39;m on my back. The bile erupts and lands all over my face, neck, and chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kuh-clean! &lt;strong&gt;Clean!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; I belch the words out, and the vomit disappears, leaving me feeling minty fresh, yet still horribly sickened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t see him. I can&amp;#39;t sense him. He&amp;#39;s a goddamn ghost, able to move faster than me and pass through walls. Compared to Beelzebub&amp;#39;s little fire-show, this Duke is unspeakably dangerous. Forget Amelia! If I can&amp;#39;t beat the Duke of Mist, I&amp;#39;m done for!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar sound catches my attention. Clicking. The sound I heard before. Staggering to my feet, my jaw drops as a massive wall of skeletons shambles toward me. These aren&amp;#39;t like the weak little buggers Beelzebub controlled. Their intricately shaped armor, enormous steel shields, and swords all speak to a level of power I haven&amp;#39;t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, skeletons usually wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem, but with Mephisto lurking around, I can&amp;#39;t afford to treat them lightly. They&amp;#39;ll distract me while he circles around and jams a knife into my back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keh keh keh... do you like my creationsss? I am the massster of Death in the Labyrinth.&amp;quot; Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice is still a little ways away. He must have punched me and stayed in his spot. &amp;quot;Reanimation isss trivial for one asss powerful asss I. The other Dukesss don&amp;#39;t underssstand the ssskill and danger involved in reanimation, but sssoon they will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My breath comes in gasps. I need to escape, but the Duke of Mist moves faster than me. I can&amp;#39;t hurt him with ordinary attacks, nor can I slow him down with barriers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think, Jason, think!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t. My head is still spinning from that spinal attack. I&amp;#39;m out of breath, exhausted, and facing a Demon Duke; one of the most powerful beings in the Labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amelia beat him in combat?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s right. She killed that Agares fellow, but Mephisto was one of the other two Dukes that were there. If the Scyther brothers weren&amp;#39;t lying, then that means he managed to escape unscathed. Perhaps Amelia couldn&amp;#39;t hurt him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;FUCK!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How do I get out of this situation?!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An idea appears. &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth a shot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Speed! Speed! Power! Power! Perception!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If the Duke of Mist is fast, then I have to be faster!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Spinning on my heel, I dash away, racing toward the fake wall I created. Unlike last time when I was with Amelia and I hyper-speed-dashed into the Great Doors of the Labyrinth Core, this time, my mind manages to keep up with the speed increase.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pound through the fake wall without stopping, rushing with all my might, occasionally yelling &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Heal!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; whenever the power threatens to tear my limbs apart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Minutes pass. I continue tearing down the Labyrinth halls at speeds approaching a hundred miles an hour. Left, right, through this path and that, I ignore my heart screaming in pain. Ultimately, I can&amp;#39;t maintain my mad dash and slow to a stop. My body aches as if death is moments away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gasping for breath, I speak again, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Normalize,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; returning my body to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Wa... Water.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the jug of icy water appears in my hand, I lift it to take a drink.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice whispers in my ear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oopsss, you almossst lossst me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dl41hl/the_cryopod_to_hell_033_stab_and_seek/?\"&gt;Next Part&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "     'selftext': 'From space, the rising of the red sun over the planet Larissa was a beautiful sight. To the inhabitants on the surface, however, it was a rather more mundane signal that the day\\'s duties were about to begin. The more discerning (or less sleep-deprived) might today have caught a slightly unusual bit of news on the morning broadcast: \"Alien probe recovered from orbit of brown dwarf. Archaeologists anticipate implications for cosmological understanding\". However, most of the students filtering into professor Sofia\\'s history class that day had overlooked the bulletin entirely, focusing instead on more pressing matters, such as the contents of their breakfast. It therefore caught almost everyone by surprise when the professor opened her lecture with the words \"Today, we rewrite all that you know about history!\"\\n\\nWhen the initial shocked silence finally started to give way anxious murmurings, the professor continued: \"As most of you know, the creation of life from its non-living, organic building blocks is exceedingly rare in the galaxy. Even in our most controlled laboratory settings, we only manage to do it artificially once for every million attempts. The odds suggest that on a galactic scale, such a thing is exceedingly rare. In fact, we can only say with certainty that it has happened twice.\"\\n\\n\"Professor, we all know this,\" one of the try-hards of the first row interjected. \"Of course you would know, Mnason\" replied the professor. \"But you must show some sympathy for the lesser of your peers, who might have foolishly chosen to spend their youths outside of their libraries\". As the laughter subsided, Mnason\\'s bent head told the professor that he would not interrupt again.\\n\\n\"Now, as you all know, we are the result of one of these successful acts of creation. The other is a mysterious ancient race of aliens, long gone by the time of our first, careful steps into space. All we have found of them are a few relics, decrepit space stations orbiting the carcasses of stars whose lights have long since dwindled into darkness, abandoned mining operations in the far reaches of dead solar systems. Nothing remains of their art, history or culture. Everything but the metal husks they used to inhabit has been blasted clean by aeons of solar wind.\"\\n\\n\"Why did they disappear, professor?\" asked a raised hand from the back of the lecture hall. Professor Sofia paused in thought for a while, before she replied \"honestly, we don\\'t really know. We have only ever found the traces of them around dead stars, so we think they preferred brighter stars than we do. It\\'s hard to imagine now, but the galaxy was once filled with light. Looking up at the night sky, your entire field of vision would have been filled with dots of white and blue\". The entire class was momentarily lost in imagination, trying to fill in the expanses between the scarce few red dots of the night sky they knew.\\n\\n\"We know that we live in an old galaxy. The dead stars far outnumber the living, and the living stars are tens and even hundreds of billions of years old. But until now, we had no clue just how ancient it really is. Did anybody pay attention to the news this morning?\" A few, scattered hands rose across the lecture theatre. \"Then you know that another alien probe was found. What the news won\\'t have told you yet, was that this one is fully intact.\" A gasp spread across the lecture theatre. \"Our archaeologists are examining it as we speak, but it appears to be a time capsule, an epitaph built by a race that knew it was dying. They must have left a message in case other life would arise after they had died. We are still deciphering the alien language, but the images and pieces of text we have translated so far are already shaking the foundations of our world view. The greatest shock is this: There used to be other galaxies! In fact, the aliens came from one!\"\\n\\nThe lecture theatre fell dead silent for a short second that nevertheless felt like an eternity. Everybody knew that beyond the edge of the galaxy lay nothingness. A vast expanse of darkness, an all-encompassing void in which nothing save the single known galaxy existed. Could other galaxies really have existed in that abyss? Where would they have gone?\\n\\nSofia continued, answering the collective question. \"From what we can decipher, the aliens tell us that there used to be as many galaxies in the sky as there are now dead stars in our galaxy. But the alien message tells of an expanding universe, in which countless other galaxies existed. The space between galaxies has since expanded so much that we can no longer see them.\"\\n\\n\"We have long thought that we were the only remaining intelligent life in the universe. Now we know that there might be other forms of life out there, floating away from us on their own galaxy!\". Another hand raised in the audience: \"Could we ever reach them?\". \"No,\" answered the professor. \"That window has closed. Not even light can travel between our galaxy and any other. The universe is old, and the age of intergalactic exploration was over long before our species even existed. We can never reach them.\"\\n\\nAnother silence fell over the lecture theatre, this time a depressed and sullen one. But professor Sofia\\'s closing words were enough to lift the somber mood a little. \"But even if they are beyond our reach, and we will never encounter another intelligent species, we might still have something in common. The ancient aliens came from another galaxy into ours; they might have crossed into others as well. Right now, forever out of our grasp, another form of life might nevertheless be exploring the same alien relics as we are. These travellers among the galaxies might be the final common thing in a universe that will never meet again.\"\\n\\nThat night, the first translated excerpt from the epitaph was released on the general news. It carried the picture of a blue planet orbiting a yellow sun, accompanied by the following inscription: \"We are the first; no one came before us, and no one has yet come after. We travelled across the darkness while the stars still burned as beacons. We were the Humans; we lived while the Universe was young.\"',\n",

The dead stars far outnumber the living, and the living stars are tens and even hundreds of billions of years old. But until now, we had no clue just how ancient it really is. Did anybody pay attention to the news this morning?&amp;quot; A few, scattered hands rose across the lecture theatre. &amp;quot;Then you know that another alien probe was found. What the news won&amp;#39;t have told you yet, was that this one is fully intact.&amp;quot; A gasp spread across the lecture theatre. &amp;quot;Our archaeologists are examining it as we speak, but it appears to be a time capsule, an epitaph built by a race that knew it was dying. They must have left a message in case other life would arise after they had died. We are still deciphering the alien language, but the images and pieces of text we have translated so far are already shaking the foundations of our world view. The greatest shock is this: There used to be other galaxies! In fact, the aliens came from one!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The lecture theatre fell dead silent for a short second that nevertheless felt like an eternity. Everybody knew that beyond the edge of the galaxy lay nothingness. A vast expanse of darkness, an all-encompassing void in which nothing save the single known galaxy existed. Could other galaxies really have existed in that abyss? Where would they have gone?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sofia continued, answering the collective question. &amp;quot;From what we can decipher, the aliens tell us that there used to be as many galaxies in the sky as there are now dead stars in our galaxy. But the alien message tells of an expanding universe, in which countless other galaxies existed. The space between galaxies has since expanded so much that we can no longer see them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We have long thought that we were the only remaining intelligent life in the universe. Now we know that there might be other forms of life out there, floating away from us on their own galaxy!&amp;quot;. Another hand raised in the audience: &amp;quot;Could we ever reach them?&amp;quot;. &amp;quot;No,&amp;quot; answered the professor. &amp;quot;That window has closed. Not even light can travel between our galaxy and any other. The universe is old, and the age of intergalactic exploration was over long before our species even existed. We can never reach them.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another silence fell over the lecture theatre, this time a depressed and sullen one. But professor Sofia&amp;#39;s closing words were enough to lift the somber mood a little. &amp;quot;But even if they are beyond our reach, and we will never encounter another intelligent species, we might still have something in common. The ancient aliens came from another galaxy into ours; they might have crossed into others as well. Right now, forever out of our grasp, another form of life might nevertheless be exploring the same alien relics as we are. These travellers among the galaxies might be the final common thing in a universe that will never meet again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That night, the first translated excerpt from the epitaph was released on the general news. It carried the picture of a blue planet orbiting a yellow sun, accompanied by the following inscription: &amp;quot;We are the first; no one came before us, and no one has yet come after. We travelled across the darkness while the stars still burned as beacons. We were the Humans; we lived while the Universe was young.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Hope you enjoy\\n\\n**Meat, the Neighbors**\\n\\n**His Greatness, General of Worlds, Herd Leader of the Proud, Tim\\'Niregarded**\\n\\n\"This will be a momentous occasion. Our Fourth First Contact. Write that down, make sure the journalists use capital letters. So do we welcome them to the herd or start shooting?\"\\n\\n\"General, they refuse to answer our questions. They insist on a meeting in neutral space. We are not to attempt any landings on the Human worlds. They seem enthusiastic about meeting us, just a little paranoid.\"\\n\\n\"Typical herd behaviour. Perhaps they have not eradicated all their predators yet. Very well. We will meet them as they wish.\"\\n\\n**The Human** delegates arrived at the station. All outgoing communications immediately shut down.\\n\\nA single human entered the meeting room. Covered head to foot, showing only it\\'s paws, five digits, no talons. Definitely a herd species.\\n\\nIt introduced itself. \"General, I am Ambassador Rince. I will represent humanity in these discussions. I am afraid no communication with your empire is possible until we conclude.\"\\n\\n**His Greatness, General of Worlds, Herd Leader of the Proud, Tim\\'Niregarded**\\n\\n“You may call me Tim”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “Thank you, Tim. I am here with grave news. The information you have provided us about your glorious empire has excited and intrigued our people. However, we fear contact between our worlds will lead to violence. I am here to help prevent that.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** “ We seek no dispute with you! Your people are as welcome to share the vastness of space as our other allies. We come in peace. Please, whatever issue you have, let us resolve it here.”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** began removing his headscarf. “I am afraid I ordered the doors sealed for this. Please try and remain calm. I promise you that we wish you no harm.”\\n\\nAt the sight of the two forward facing eyes the Ambassador revealed, Tim\\'Niregarded felt a panic he had not known since he was a calf. Only one type of creature had eyes like that. He was trapped with a beast. They had not eradicated their predators, they were the predators. What madness had he inflicted on his herd. A space faring evil. They were doomed, all doomed.\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ Please General, Tim, we are here to secure peace between our people. When we received your information we were surprised, more than surprised, that our neighbours were all herbivores. It had never occurred to us that such a thing was possible.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** resisted the urge to run. He was a soldier, he had stood before enemies before and held his ground. If he was slaughtered and eaten in this room, he would keep his pride. Also the door was locked.\\n\\n“What do you want of us Predator? We will not be food! We have destroyed any that would prey upon us before and we will do it again if necessary. The Herd is strong.”\\n\\nHe knew he was lying. The moment his people found out that millions of space borne predators lived next door, they would flee. Chaos would descend on the worlds.\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “Perhaps now you understand the caution in how we chose to meet you. We are not, as you put it, Predators. Simply we have evolved from an omnivorous species. Our food now, is of course, entirely ethical, even by your own standards. Your dismay is what we seek to avoid. If your people react like that, there will never be peace between us.”\\n\\nAt that Ambassador Rince fully revealed his face, laying the cloth on the table between them. He sat quietly, allowing the general time to gather his thoughts. He began pouring the tea that his staff had thoughtfully provided.\\n\\n“Perhaps I can offer you a cup? I find it calms the nerves. We call this blend Earl Grey, although i have no idea why. It is perfectly safe for your species.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** accepted the cup. If all else failed it would serve as a weapon. The unnerving stillness in Ambassador Rince wasn’t helping. He felt emotions long dismissed by his people. The fears of a child. The fears that his kind had felt in the long battle with those that regarded them as prey.\\n\\n“Fine words. Your face is the face of our darkest fears. I do not trust you. Your teeth, your eyes tells me what you are. No. I know why you hid yourselves from us. You wait in ambush like all your kind.”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ I am authorising you and you staff full access to our data net. Please be aware that it is uncensored and, to be honest, smutty. You may search our history. There are terrors there. Even for us. We are not what we were, we have found peace after many battles. As did you. The difference is that we fought ourselves. The door is open General, please consult with your staff. My people will remain in seclusion until we meet again.”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** watched as his staff uncovered horror after horror. Thousands of years of murderous greed. Those closest to his species were slaughtered and eaten or breed to imbecility to serve the perverse tastes of these creatures. Everything on this twisted planet was a predator.\\n\\nThen it began to change. They found peace amongst themselves when they gained space. New worlds, new technologies freed them from the chains of a deathworld. They retreated to the cities, rebuilding the wild planet they had inherited. Herds roamed free, challenged only by their natural predators. Food was created by machine. Disgusting forms of protein still, but now no pain. No hunting. No killing. They proudly recorded that no animal had been killed for food in a thousand years. A bizarre boast.\\n\\n“ Inform Ambassador Rince that we need to meet.”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “I am grateful that we meet again. It gives me hope for the future. How may I help?”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** “We have studied your past. My staff are of the opinion that you pose no threat to us. I do not concur. However, we are neighbours and, despite your disgusting habits, we must come to some arrangement. Since you have had longer to consider this than I, what suggestions do you have?”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ Tell me General, what is your people’s proudest moment? The one you still celebrate every year? From your information it was the burning of the last den of, well, wolves would be the closest thing we have. Your people killed them all. Correct?”\\n\\n**Tim\\'Niregarded** “Yes, finally our people were safe. Our greatest achievement!”\\n\\n**Ambassador Rince** “ Am I right that you had achieved space travel by then? That you numbered in the billions? I am afraid what you celebrate would be regarded as the ultimate crime by our people. \\n\\nYour ongoing massacres of any meat eating animal would lead to war if my people found out. I’m afraid that until your species learns to peacefully coexist with other creatures we will have to restrict your access to our space. This station will serve as our only meeting place. Such a pity.”',\n",

The Herd is strong.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He knew he was lying. The moment his people found out that millions of space borne predators lived next door, they would flee. Chaos would descend on the worlds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “Perhaps now you understand the caution in how we chose to meet you. We are not, as you put it, Predators. Simply we have evolved from an omnivorous species. Our food now, is of course, entirely ethical, even by your own standards. Your dismay is what we seek to avoid. If your people react like that, there will never be peace between us.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;At that Ambassador Rince fully revealed his face, laying the cloth on the table between them. He sat quietly, allowing the general time to gather his thoughts. He began pouring the tea that his staff had thoughtfully provided.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps I can offer you a cup? I find it calms the nerves. We call this blend Earl Grey, although i have no idea why. It is perfectly safe for your species.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; accepted the cup. If all else failed it would serve as a weapon. The unnerving stillness in Ambassador Rince wasn’t helping. He felt emotions long dismissed by his people. The fears of a child. The fears that his kind had felt in the long battle with those that regarded them as prey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fine words. Your face is the face of our darkest fears. I do not trust you. Your teeth, your eyes tells me what you are. No. I know why you hid yourselves from us. You wait in ambush like all your kind.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “ I am authorising you and you staff full access to our data net. Please be aware that it is uncensored and, to be honest, smutty. You may search our history. There are terrors there. Even for us. We are not what we were, we have found peace after many battles. As did you. The difference is that we fought ourselves. The door is open General, please consult with your staff. My people will remain in seclusion until we meet again.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; watched as his staff uncovered horror after horror. Thousands of years of murderous greed. Those closest to his species were slaughtered and eaten or breed to imbecility to serve the perverse tastes of these creatures. Everything on this twisted planet was a predator.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Then it began to change. They found peace amongst themselves when they gained space. New worlds, new technologies freed them from the chains of a deathworld. They retreated to the cities, rebuilding the wild planet they had inherited. Herds roamed free, challenged only by their natural predators. Food was created by machine. Disgusting forms of protein still, but now no pain. No hunting. No killing. They proudly recorded that no animal had been killed for food in a thousand years. A bizarre boast.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“ Inform Ambassador Rince that we need to meet.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “I am grateful that we meet again. It gives me hope for the future. How may I help?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; “We have studied your past. My staff are of the opinion that you pose no threat to us. I do not concur. However, we are neighbours and, despite your disgusting habits, we must come to some arrangement. Since you have had longer to consider this than I, what suggestions do you have?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “ Tell me General, what is your people’s proudest moment? The one you still celebrate every year? From your information it was the burning of the last den of, well, wolves would be the closest thing we have. Your people killed them all. Correct?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Tim&amp;#39;Niregarded&lt;/strong&gt; “Yes, finally our people were safe. Our greatest achievement!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ambassador Rince&lt;/strong&gt; “ Am I right that you had achieved space travel by then? That you numbered in the billions? I am afraid what you celebrate would be regarded as the ultimate crime by our people. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Your ongoing massacres of any meat eating animal would lead to war if my people found out. I’m afraid that until your species learns to peacefully coexist with other creatures we will have to restrict your access to our space. This station will serve as our only meeting place. Such a pity.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'We had said that laughing behind our cupped hands, with pity and second-hand embarrassment. The humans had literally stumbled their way onto the galactic scene, a simple one-planet species and barely civilized. Their lifespans were little longer than those of their ancestor apes and outside the backwater planet (that they insisted on calling \\'Earth\\', even if most of its surface area was covered in water) they had only the tiniest of settlements. Into citadel space they had come with simple iron ships that brute-forced their way through the dimensions to achieve faster-than-light speeds. When they had made first contact, they actually had to send a ship back to inform their people because they didn\\'t have any way of communicating instantaneously over even tiny distances in space. Grudgingly their civilisation was acknowledged by the council, our vote was not behind that.\\n\\nIt only made them become the most annoying peddlers of the galaxy. The galactic council was based on contracts between the many species in citadel space. Contracts that were debated, evaluated, negotiated, rewritten and refined usually over a hundred cycles before there was any hope of approval from both sides. How could these simple beings with a lifespan not even half that understand these proceedings? They didn\\'t, the humans rudely ignored all that and just send envoys out to offer pacts and agreements no one cared about. \"The humans are here\", we said with annoyance, tired of their many times they stood on our doorstep to attempt feeble diplomatic discourse. More out of pity than anything else we gave them some scraps and FTL communication technology (in the hopes they would at least stop visiting in person) and signed off on their worthless offerings.\\n\\nOne thing that was noticeable about them was their hardiness. Coming from a world with a vast range of climates, they could adapt to practically any living conditions encountered on other citadel species worlds. And for some reason they enjoyed moving across half the galaxy to live in a jarringly different culture (gleefully adopting whatever outlandish social rules these had). Within not even one of their lifetimes, they had people living on the many thousands of planets of whatever species foolishly allowed them to come. We saw these places marred by the presence of these over-enthusiastic apes and whenever one of the popular destinations of our people was overran with them, we turned away with disgust and said \"The humans are here.\" Our own planets were kept clean of them and we did not allow them to settle anywhere in our space.\\n\\nMore cycles passed as we noticed a new trend. The younger ones of our people began seeking the fortune in the stars, away from the stability and security of our civilized systems. We found the cause of that to be the humans. They foolishly jumped headlong into colonizing barely habitable planets, surviving only because of their hardiness. Surprisingly, they then set the groundwork to terraform them, working on creating conditions other council species could survive in as well. These colonies were flocked to by many, promising a honest life for hard work and offering cheap living space even for the largest of families. \"The humans are here\", became a call for willing settlers, assuring every being of a safe haven that could be shared by all.\\n\\nAs the humans went forth to tame the most dangerous regions of the galaxy, they brought back a wealth of resources. Bypassing the galactic council again, they began trading with anyone willing. Within another one of their short lifetimes they had built a network of exchange that rivalled the official citadel platforms. We could not avoid joining into trade with them, as they offered the most coveted of wares from many different cultures that had previously been hidden behind unfinished agreements, some for thousands of cycles. As one of our planets after the other established trade routes with the humans, with hidden joy we said \"The humans are here\" when their ships turned up on our ports, promising a new influx of goods and wealth and leading to new prosperity for all our people.\\n\\nThat upswing ended abruptly when in a political move (that had not thought to even be possible) we were exiled from the galactic council. An opponent pushed us into disgrace in front of all the citadel species, instantly severing the many millennia old pacts and cutting our access to the FTL travel network. In less than a cycle our civilisation was practically shattered to pieces, each planet on its own and powerless to defend itself against the planned invasion from our opponent. With travel blockages set up in all our systems it was clear that utter annihilation was their set goal. As we stood before our ruin, a representative of the humans contacted us to offer their aid and protection, pointing at the treaties we had long since forgotten about. We thanked them for their honour and refused as we were staring at death and there was no need for them to pointlessly die with us. They did not listen and sent their iron battleships that circumvented the blockages through their brute-force FTL travel method. Their considerable military might was hitherto unknown. And as they jumped in by the ten-thousands in all our inhabited systems, we cried out \"The humans are here!\", with tears in our eyes and rekindled hope. They stood with us steadfast, weathering countless strikes before our opponent gave up the direct approach in frustration.\\n\\nIt took many cycles before we were able to re-establish formal communication with the galactic council and many more to clear our species from the false allegations before we could finally reinstate the old contracts. Back in power, we pinned the blame at our opponent and from that we gained leverage that we immediately used to incite the greatest assembly of political leaders in the history of the galactic council. Now we stand before all of them to invite the humans into the citadel and onto the podium. Our trade partners, our allies, our friends. And through rising cheers - with pride, conviction and deepest admiration - we say: \"The humans are here.\"',\n",

What kind of species could think up something like *this?* By accounts, their planet is *overrun* with life. Like most others, there\\'s weather. Climates. Active geology.

Though… you\\'re not the first to voice concerns. Some including fleet brass. And chaplains. We pushed back to the Humans, and eventually they provided what they said was an *extremely* non-regulation manual on the care and usage of this… product. We were suspicious about some of the claims made in the document, but several R&amp;D divisions back in the core territories have gone through and confirmed every usage. On top of what it says on the label, these can be used as various types of improvised explosives, three kinds of projectile weapon, repair supplies for a half-dozen vehicle and vessel subsystems, medical supplies for more than half the races in the Fleet, and, with certain kinds, a short-range communications system. There are also rare but confirmed reports of Humans successfully performing rearguard actions against overwhelming numbers using these.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n“Okay. Fine. So this… Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide is chock-full of non-regulation uses for these. That just drives home my point about their base use, sir. At least tell me that the supply lines have been secured, and we’ll be resupplying with shipments from sane races? I know the Humans are some of the core of our defense, and have been in the forefront of some of our roughest offenses. Could we get them back doing *that*, and leave the supply lines to some of our… less effective frontliners?”\\n\\n“The point remains. We need these. The Humans are the only ones getting them to us reliably. The Nemesis fleets know where most of our ships must pass through from our core worlds, to reach the Front. The Humans, with their darkspace stations scattered through the Void, have more options on getting what we need, where we need it. So until we can better secure our lines, we’re stuck with these. You don’t have to like it. I sure don’t. Each time I have to break one out, it hurts my soul. But without them, we’d be dead in space.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n“... Fine. *Fine.* Give me the Guide. But I’m not happy about this.”\\xa0 \\n\\n“You and me both, Trooper. You and me both.”\\xa0\\xa0\\n\\n---\\n\\n*The trooper stomped off, grumbling, and started thumbing through the Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide for MREs. Page One, Rule One: Recipe 23 is for fresh recruits only. If you are issued Recipe 23, by any means necessary reallocate it.*\\xa0\\n\\n“I still don’t see how they could eat *any* of these … Emareees of theirs.”',\n",

We pushed back to the Humans, and eventually they provided what they said was an &lt;em&gt;extremely&lt;/em&gt; non-regulation manual on the care and usage of this… product. We were suspicious about some of the claims made in the document, but several R&amp;amp;D divisions back in the core territories have gone through and confirmed every usage. On top of what it says on the label, these can be used as various types of improvised explosives, three kinds of projectile weapon, repair supplies for a half-dozen vehicle and vessel subsystems, medical supplies for more than half the races in the Fleet, and, with certain kinds, a short-range communications system. There are also rare but confirmed reports of Humans successfully performing rearguard actions against overwhelming numbers using these.”\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Okay. Fine. So this… Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide is chock-full of non-regulation uses for these. That just drives home my point about their base use, sir. At least tell me that the supply lines have been secured, and we’ll be resupplying with shipments from sane races? I know the Humans are some of the core of our defense, and have been in the forefront of some of our roughest offenses. Could we get them back doing &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt;, and leave the supply lines to some of our… less effective frontliners?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The point remains. We need these. The Humans are the only ones getting them to us reliably. The Nemesis fleets know where most of our ships must pass through from our core worlds, to reach the Front. The Humans, with their darkspace stations scattered through the Void, have more options on getting what we need, where we need it. So until we can better secure our lines, we’re stuck with these. You don’t have to like it. I sure don’t. Each time I have to break one out, it hurts my soul. But without them, we’d be dead in space.”\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“... Fine. &lt;em&gt;Fine.&lt;/em&gt; Give me the Guide. But I’m not happy about this.”\\xa0 &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You and me both, Trooper. You and me both.”\\xa0\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The trooper stomped off, grumbling, and started thumbing through the Skippy Carlson’s Non-Regulation Usage Guide for MREs. Page One, Rule One: Recipe 23 is for fresh recruits only. If you are issued Recipe 23, by any means necessary reallocate it.&lt;/em&gt;\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I still don’t see how they could eat &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; of these … Emareees of theirs.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Carraclough\\n\\nPresident\\n\\nThe White House\\n\\n1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW\\n\\nWashington, DC 20502\\n\\nPlanet Earth\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nRE: Human Dubrian Trade Negotiations\\n\\nDear Mr. President:\\n\\nI want to express my genuine gratitude for the effort you and your retinue have displayed to date advancing the trade discussions between our great nations. I know all too well how difficult it is to balance the wants and perceived needs of a diverse populace, made even more difficult by the truly alien nature of your counterpart’s. Indeed, I genuinely anticipate our continued debates on the minutiae of luxury goods tariffs. Unfortunately, taking both our great People’s economic interests fully to brain, I can not in good faith accept anything less than an equal border taxation rate on a long-term trade deal, regardless of the current trade imbalance.\\n\\nThe above being written, I do have a proposal in mind that could “sweeten the pot”. And please, forgive the backstory I am about to embark on, but I believe it fully relevant to our discourse.\\n\\nAs I am sure you are aware due to the exorbitant amount of media coverage the process originated, your predecessor gave several gifts to both my People, and me, at the beginning of her term. The specific gift this anecdote centers around is Maggie.\\n\\nAccording to my cultural advisors, Maggie was quite the appropriate gift. I fondly remember the first time I laid eyes on her, looking like a living lump of coal in her handler’s arms, intelligently taking in the sight and smells of a new world. Oblivious to the learned habits of her kin, Maggie quickly took to Dubrian traditions, licking those around her as a sign of affection.\\n\\nOriginally named Magnolia, a symbol of your Southern States, I settled on appropriating the human tradition of “nicknaming” her, in an effort to give myself a daily reminder of the people to whom I can thank for her presence in my life. An intelligent creature, she has cleverly associated my use of her full title with my displeasure with her malignant behavior.\\n\\nPer the included instructions, I housed her, fed her, played with her, and gave her a loving home. We Dubrians require daily exercise, much as you humans do, to maintain our physical fitness. I began including Maggie in these exercised once she reached her, admittedly large, adult size and weight at approximately one of your Earth years since her arrival.\\n\\nOur runs quickly became highlights of my day. They afforded me the ability to clear my brain, escape the trappings of my position, and reflect upon unbridled love. And what love did she give! I do not recall a single time she was not enthralled at my presence, as if I was the physical embodiment of her every want and desire. I do not need to bore you with details of the adventures we had together, oft to the chagrin of my protective escort, suffice to say they were numerous and each rank highly upon my personal list of happiest memories.\\n\\nLast week, coinciding with the height of our negotiative trade week, was our last such daily run. I know what you are thinking and no, she has not perished from this or any world – yet. But, her joints are no longer cooperating with her aging body, and my simplest pleasure is no longer physically possible for my best friend.\\n\\nAnd that is exactly what she has become. My best friend.\\n\\nI realize now what her handler meant when she handed Maggie off to me, saying “I give you Man’s best friend, in hopes that Humanity can become Dubrian’s interstellar friends.”\\n\\nWith this very personal anecdote in mind, I come to my proposal:\\n\\nAs stated previously, we require an equal border taxation rate on luxury goods imported between our nations for a period of fifty rotations of your Earth around your Sol. Additionally, we will willingly accept, paying all associated costs, any unwanted canines plaguing your nation’s animal hospitals and impounds. We promise to give them our whole brains, loving households, licks of affection, and, of course, daily runs.\\n\\nWill you allow your best friend, to become our best friend, and therefore make us friends?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSincerely,\\n\\nVolvap A.

       "   'selftext': 'Author\\'s note: Sorry for the long delay between chapters this time around, but at least it\\'s a longer post?  :D  It didn\\'t get as far as I was hoping for, but it had been such a long time since the last chapter, I felt like maybe I was at a good place for a break.  Boy, having things to do outside of the internet sure makes this go slower...\\n\\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9fumh/pi_a_demon_from_earth_a_youve_been_summoned/) / [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhzjxp/pi_a_demon_from_earth_ch_11/)\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\nIt had been about 3 hours since I woke up and took my meds when I set all the alarms.  One on the way out, one I silenced early because we were in the forest near Gennie, one on the way back, and about an hour to the next.  That\\'s fourteen hours.  I\\'d better get this figured out.\\n\\n\"OK.  Can you ask one of those guys\", I jerk my head towards the guards, \"to go ask the King if he would be so kind as to join us for a discussion of the situation?\"  I\\'m trying my very best to use polite and diplomatic language here, even if I have a feeling it\\'s not going to do much good, and it\\'s not my most well honed skill.\\n\\nFriday, who seems to be more positively disposed towards me, says something to the group of guards in that highly musical tongue of theirs.  Given that these guys all have fairly high pitched voices, and as with humans, the women are generally more high pitched than the men, it sounds halfway to a soprano solo every time she talks to them.  One of them sings something back at her, and turns around and heads out the door.\\n\\nI take a closer look at Friday.  What had at first seemed like blue eyes, I now note, have a slight purple tinge to them.  And what I had taken for platinum blonde hair, the sort you only see in certain Norse extractions, actually has a bit of a purple tone to it as well.  Looking over at Oz, I note that while I\\'d seen his hair as just the \\'white\\' of age, it has the same purple hint as well.\\n\\n\"Hey Friday,\" I open, \"I just noticed that you and the High Wizard\", (can\\'t hurt to at least *try* and assuage his ego a hair) \"have the same hair color.  Are you related, or is that a common thing among your people?\"\\n\\n\"He is my uncle.  My mother\\'s brother.  The ability to harness mystical energies is a thing that travels within my family, and is always accompanied by this mark.\"\\n\\n\"Ah, OK.  Interesting.  So, is that a particularly **rare** thing?  Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability?\"\\n\\n\"Oh no.  I have no siblings.  My mother died bearing me, and my father never remarried.  But it is hoped that when I have children, one of them will carry the gift.\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m very sorry to hear that.  I hope for the best for you and your potential progeny.\"\\n\\n\"It is kind of you to say so.\"\\n\\nI continued, \"So, I\\'m obviously not familiar with your traditions here.  Is the leader always male, or is a Queen a possibility?  Does the King have any other children, another son or daughter?\"\\n\\n\"A daughter may become a Queen, if she is the one to inherit.  But the King has no other children.  His wife died during childbirth, and he never remarried.\"\\n\\n\"I, uh... Hrm.  OK, so, maybe I just have really bad luck, but that\\'s two women in a row you\\'ve told me about that have died in childbirth.  Is that sort of thing a frequent occurrence here?\"\\n\\n\"It is unfortunately quite common.  About one in thirty children have their mother die while bearing them.  So, for the most part, women will only have one or two children.\"\\n\\n\"One in ***THIRTY***?!\", I shouted, \"Holy ***FUCKBALLS!***  You don\\'t need me to save you from a fucking **dragon***, you need me to save you from atrocious medicine!  Where I come from, the maternal death rate is more like one in five **thousand**.  Ok.  Wow.  I mean, I\\'m just trained in emergency medicine, but, I am **really** going to have to talk to whoever is in charge of delivering children around here before I go.  OK, ok, before I get too sidetracked, you said the King only had one son, so who is next in line for... uh, guys?  Friday?  Oz?\"\\n\\nIt was around this moment that I noticed that both Oz and Friday were staring at me in pure, gape-jawed shock.\\n\\n\"Um, you guys OK there\", I ventured.\\n\\nI honestly wasn\\'t sure they had even heard me.  I snapped my fingers.  \"**Guys!**  You all right?\"\\n\\nOz seemed to recover a little bit.  \"You... you speak of miracles!\"\\n\\n\"No, you guys are speaking of **horrors**.  One in *thirty*.  That\\'s worse than the bloody Dark Ages.  Hell, one in five thousand isn\\'t even all that great.  Some countries, errr, \\'kingdoms\\', where I\\'m from, it\\'s down around one in *ten* thousand.  Then again, some of \\'em are lots worse, but even so, I think the **worst** are closer to one in sixty.  And that\\'s like, places that have been under constant siege and war for the last fifty years.\"\\n\\nFriday spoke in rushed words, \"If you could teach us this, that would be *far* more valuable than destroying the dragon!  I think even the King might agree, despite his rage and despair at the loss of his son!\"\\n\\n\"I mean, I\\'m happy to help out there.  I\\'ll need to talk to your healer over there, or your midwives, or, well, quite possibly all of the above.  But seriously, though, what does your line of succession look like?  As in, now that the King\\'s heir apparent has passed on, who would ascend to the throne if the King were to meet an unfortunate end?\"\\n\\nFriday thought about the question for a moment, before replying, \"The King\\'s younger sister seems most likely.  A half-sister technically, as the former King\\'s first wife\", I cut her off with a mildly acerbic \"Lemme guess, died in childbirth?\"\\n\\n\"Ah, yes.  It would most typically fall to her, although she is still quite young, having just celebrated her 500th, ah, I think the closest term in your language would be \\'season\\'.   Being such a youth, she has not yet had any children, of course, and typically, one cannot be named Queen without having born at least one heir.  Since the risk to mothers is so high, we prefer to crown those who are unlikely to pass away during birth, so as to maintain stability of rule.  Thus, the Prince\\'s son would also be a consideration, though he is barely 300.\"\\n\\n\"Wait, 500 seasons?  How long are these seasons?\"\\n\\n\"It takes nine days for the stars to circle once.  Call that a \\'week\\'.  Ten cycles of the stars is the period I am calling a \\'season\\'.  Four of those would be equivalent to your \\'year\\', or so?  Thus, the King\\'s sister is a mere youth of 125 of your years!\"\\n\\n\"OK, um, wow.  That\\'s the very longest any of my people live, pretty much ever.  And you say she\\'s still considered a youth?\"\\n\\n\"Well, 500 seasons is a fairly special occasion.  It is when one of our people is generally considered to finally be an adult.  Though just barely.  2500 seasons is what would be considered the average life expectancy if one avoids misfortune, though some have lived to see their 3000th season.\"\\n\\n\"Whew.  OK, lemme do some math real quick.  If 500 seasons is assumed to be about the equivalent of our 18 years, then 2500 seasons would be about 90, 3000 seasons would be like, 108, and the Prince\\'s son would be almost 11.  Yikes, OK, I can see why you\\'d have some issues there.  What are your infants like, the newborns?  Do... uh, wow, hrm.  Are you guys even mammals?  That is, I see that you are generally shaped like myself and Anneke here, with the same general differences between the sexes.  When your people give birth, do you produce nutrition for the infants from your breasts?  That\\'s a common feature of a whole class of different types of animals on my world, including us, the humans.\"\\n\\n\"Yes.  Mothers produce milk for the first ten seasons or so after birth, by which time, a baby can eat a wider variety of foods, and walk, though not very well.  This is also about the time when a child will start learning to talk, again, not very well.  By their fiftieth season or so, a child will have developed the ability to be reasoned with, although they are still... child-like.  Between the fiftieth and four hundred fiftieth season, they will play with others of the same age group, and begin to learn a skill, and go through general education in the way of the world.  By the time they reach the five hundredth season, a child of my people will generally have become a mostly responsible adult, although still occasionally prone to passionate behavior and reckless action.\"\\n\\n\"OK, wow.  So a very extended adolecence.  Hey, Anneke, so, you might find the Prince\\'s son a good companion.  You\\'re what, 13 or so?\"\\n\\nAnneke gave me a mildly irritated look.  \"I\\'m **16**, thank you.  I know I look younger than that, but it\\'s true.  I will graduate from the Gymnasium next year!  My mother was also very petite.\"\\n\\nI took that in.  Between the tears and the stature, Anneke had looked more like a child to me, but now that I examined her more closely, I could see that her face had less of that shape, and was more like an adult\\'s, even if, as she said, she was quite small.  \"Hrm.  Um, what do you mean by \\'was\\' small?  If I\\'m not sticking my foot further into my mouth.\"\\n\\n\"My... my parents died a few years ago, in a car crash\", she replied, with a sad note in her voice.  \"I live with my cousins and my aunt and uncle, now.\"\\n\\n\"Oh\", I replied, eloquently.\\n\\n\"So perhaps I would do better making friends with the King\\'s little sister\", she continued, somewhat hotly.\\n\\n\"Indeed.  My apologies for assuming you were still a child, and for bringing up what must be a painful topic.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s... it\\'s fine.  I\\'m used to it.\"\\n\\nShe seemed less than fine, honestly, but I didn\\'t want to push it.  I turned back to Oz and Friday.  \"And you, ah, sir?  Do you have any children of your own?\"\\n\\nOz proudly replied, \"I have two children, in fact.  A boy and a girl, the first a fine young man of 920 seasons, and the second a lovely little girl of 240.  My son is right over there, in fact\", he gestured to the younger of the two apprentices assisting the healer, \"and he is fast becoming quite adept in medicine!  A fine career, though I must admit that I wish he had been born with the gift, so he could follow in my footsteps.  Alas, it was not to be.  But, my wife survived both births!  And if you truly can help us to save more of our mothers, wives, and daughters when they bear our children... perhaps I could have a third child.  And perhaps they might have the gift.\"\\n\\n\"As I said, I\\'ll be happy to discuss it with whoever is appropriate here.\"\\n\\nFriday looked like she was about to say more, when the soldier who had left earlier came back through the door, stomped his feet, and came to attention.  Everyone else in the room stood up, so I looked over at Anneke, \"Let\\'s try and make a good impression, shall we?\" and stood myself.  Anneke was up before I was, actually, but at 16, I doubted her knees and back were as bad off as mine.\\n\\nThe King, who had seemed like a moderately affable fellow when I dropped myself into his meal last night, looked rather less cheerful at the moment.  Well, hopefully that was because it was still fairly early in the day, and not a bad sign for the upcoming conversation.\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9fumh/pi_a_demon_from_earth_a_youve_been_summoned/) / [Previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhzjxp/pi_a_demon_from_earth_ch_11/)',\n",

Boy, having things to do outside of the internet sure makes this go slower...&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9fumh/pi_a_demon_from_earth_a_youve_been_summoned/\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhzjxp/pi_a_demon_from_earth_ch_11/\"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It had been about 3 hours since I woke up and took my meds when I set all the alarms.  One on the way out, one I silenced early because we were in the forest near Gennie, one on the way back, and about an hour to the next.  That&amp;#39;s fourteen hours.  I&amp;#39;d better get this figured out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;OK.  Can you ask one of those guys&amp;quot;, I jerk my head towards the guards, &amp;quot;to go ask the King if he would be so kind as to join us for a discussion of the situation?&amp;quot;  I&amp;#39;m trying my very best to use polite and diplomatic language here, even if I have a feeling it&amp;#39;s not going to do much good, and it&amp;#39;s not my most well honed skill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Friday, who seems to be more positively disposed towards me, says something to the group of guards in that highly musical tongue of theirs.  Given that these guys all have fairly high pitched voices, and as with humans, the women are generally more high pitched than the men, it sounds halfway to a soprano solo every time she talks to them.  One of them sings something back at her, and turns around and heads out the door.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I take a closer look at Friday.  What had at first seemed like blue eyes, I now note, have a slight purple tinge to them.  And what I had taken for platinum blonde hair, the sort you only see in certain Norse extractions, actually has a bit of a purple tone to it as well.  Looking over at Oz, I note that while I&amp;#39;d seen his hair as just the &amp;#39;white&amp;#39; of age, it has the same purple hint as well.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hey Friday,&amp;quot; I open, &amp;quot;I just noticed that you and the High Wizard&amp;quot;, (can&amp;#39;t hurt to at least &lt;em&gt;try&lt;/em&gt; and assuage his ego a hair) &amp;quot;have the same hair color.  Are you related, or is that a common thing among your people?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He is my uncle.  My mother&amp;#39;s brother.  The ability to harness mystical energies is a thing that travels within my family, and is always accompanied by this mark.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ah, OK.  Interesting.  So, is that a particularly &lt;strong&gt;rare&lt;/strong&gt; thing?  Do you have any brothers or sisters with the same ability?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no.  I have no siblings.  My mother died bearing me, and my father never remarried.  But it is hoped that when I have children, one of them will carry the gift.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m very sorry to hear that.  I hope for the best for you and your potential progeny.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is kind of you to say so.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I continued, &amp;quot;So, I&amp;#39;m obviously not familiar with your traditions here.  Is the leader always male, or is a Queen a possibility?  Does the King have any other children, another son or daughter?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;A daughter may become a Queen, if she is the one to inherit.  But the King has no other children.  His wife died during childbirth, and he never remarried.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I, uh... Hrm.  OK, so, maybe I just have really bad luck, but that&amp;#39;s two women in a row you&amp;#39;ve told me about that have died in childbirth.  Is that sort of thing a frequent occurrence here?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;It is unfortunately quite common.  About one in thirty children have their mother die while bearing them.  So, for the most part, women will only have one or two children.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;One in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;THIRTY&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;?!&amp;quot;, I shouted, &amp;quot;Holy &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;FUCKBALLS!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  You don&amp;#39;t need me to save you from a fucking &lt;strong&gt;dragon&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;, you need me to save you from atrocious medicine!  Where I come from, the maternal death rate is more like one in five *&lt;/em&gt;thousand&lt;strong&gt;.  Ok.  Wow.  I mean, I&amp;#39;m just trained in emergency medicine, but, I am **really&lt;/strong&gt; going to have to talk to whoever is in charge of delivering children around here before I go.

I snapped my fingers.  &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Guys!&lt;/strong&gt;  You all right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oz seemed to recover a little bit.  &amp;quot;You... you speak of miracles!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No, you guys are speaking of &lt;strong&gt;horrors&lt;/strong&gt;.  One in &lt;em&gt;thirty&lt;/em&gt;.  That&amp;#39;s worse than the bloody Dark Ages.  Hell, one in five thousand isn&amp;#39;t even all that great.  Some countries, errr, &amp;#39;kingdoms&amp;#39;, where I&amp;#39;m from, it&amp;#39;s down around one in &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; thousand.  Then again, some of &amp;#39;em are lots worse, but even so, I think the &lt;strong&gt;worst&lt;/strong&gt; are closer to one in sixty.

Do you have any children of your own?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Oz proudly replied, &amp;quot;I have two children, in fact.  A boy and a girl, the first a fine young man of 920 seasons, and the second a lovely little girl of 240.  My son is right over there, in fact&amp;quot;, he gestured to the younger of the two apprentices assisting the healer, &amp;quot;and he is fast becoming quite adept in medicine!  A fine career, though I must admit that I wish he had been born with the gift, so he could follow in my footsteps.  Alas, it was not to be.  But, my wife survived both births!  And if you truly can help us to save more of our mothers, wives, and daughters when they bear our children... perhaps I could have a third child.

Well, hopefully that was because it was still fairly early in the day, and not a bad sign for the upcoming conversation.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d9fumh/pi_a_demon_from_earth_a_youve_been_summoned/\"&gt;First&lt;/a&gt; / &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dhzjxp/pi_a_demon_from_earth_ch_11/\"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': '  \\n\\n“Grandfather?”\\n\\nVree looked up from his book at the sound of his human’s voice, cracking with genuine surprise. Human-Amir was supposed to be resting and was instead insisting on spending time lounging in his family’s apartments in the hours before the Naming of his newborn nephew.\\n\\nThe sight of a tall man, dressed in the robes of one of Humanity’s desert people, embroidered with deep shimmering flames, was somewhat unexpected. \\n\\nAl’Mudhib. One of the Seven Djinn Kings.\\n\\nThe last time Vree saw this particular being, he was casually discussing the complete destruction of a species that dared to offend him with a dragon who was as old or older than Humanity itself.\\n\\nVree flattened his ears and tried very hard to hide behind his book. It didn’t work, there was simply too much of him, but he tried anyway.\\n\\n“You were kidnapped,” Al’Mudhib said in reply to his grandson’s surprise, and came over to examine Human-Amir carefully, tutting over his injuries. “Why did you not spend your Wish?”\\n\\nWish? What was a Wish? This must be yet another oddity of Humanity’s Other community, and now Vree was wishing for something to take notes.\\n\\n“I didn’t know if I would need it later,” Human-Amir admitted, as shamefaced as he ever got, and polite under the eye of his many-times-great grandfather. “I thought about it, but I decided to save it instead.”\\n\\n“You would not have had a later if you died, foolish boy,” Al’Mudhib scolded him, and snapped his fingers imperiously. All of Human-Amir’s injuries healed all at once, and he was suddenly in clothing very nearly as fine as Al’Mudhib’s himself. “There. And you-“\\n\\nVree remembered that he was trying to be a chair and did his best not to scramble for cover when Al’Mudhib’s eyes landed on him. \\n\\nHe did not want to find out what a djinn was, please. Human-Amir was bad enough when he was killing entire crews of pirates, and this great being was infinitely more powerful. \\n\\n“Sir,” he replied, and got to his feet, ignoring his trembling knees while he did it, and dropped his head politely. His official job at this event was to represent his people, and wasn’t *that* just a slammed door on the tail. “Greetings from Ha’reet, and my congratulations on your new grandkit.”\\n\\n“You’re so polite,” Human-Amir grumbled resentfully, but he sounded amused too. “You make me look bad.”\\n\\nVree flicked an ear at him but kept his eyes on the floor, offering no challenge-gaze whatsoever. \\n\\n“You *are* polite,” Al’Mudhib commented with something like approval. “And you do well at keeping my fool of a grandson out of trouble. I am told that you were the terror of your ship while seeking his rescue. I do not hold you responsible for his capture.”\\n\\nVree tried not to breathe a sigh of relief.\\n\\nVree definitely breathed a sigh of relief.\\n\\nHe did not want Human-Amir’s terrifying grandfather to do something terrible to him. \\n\\nThe old not-a-human looked like the vindictive sort. It was probably for the best that Human-Amir killed all of the pirates who carried him off. Whatever his grandfather did to them would certainly have been worse. \\n\\n“Well,” he said at last, and clamped a hand on his grandson’s shoulder preemptively. Human-Amir wiggled somewhat, but Vree was pleased to see someone else scruff him for once. “Shall we go and meet the new child?”\\n\\n“You don’t need to drag me,” Human-Amir protested as his grandfather propelled him down the long hallway with Vree trailing after them for lack of anything better to do with himself. “I *want* to meet the baby!”\\n\\n“You always need to be scruffed.”\\n\\nHuman-Luka appeared out of a nearby door, for once garbed in a sharp-cut suit, the garb of a human royal, with a long red scarf around his throat rather than the tie most humans chose. He bowed his head politely to Al’Mudhib and came in for a hug from Human-Amir. \\n\\n“You look better,” he commented, and came for a hug from Vree as well, who scent-marked his head in return but refrained from grooming his hair. “Hullo Vree.”\\n\\nAlright, so maybe Vree was inclined to adopt Human-Luka too. He seemed much better-tempered than Human-Amir. How much worse could he be?\\n\\n“Hello, Imperial Highness,” Vree said, and chuckled when the young prince scowled playfully up at him. “When you told me that Carrier *Pacifica* was large, you failed to mention that it is the size of a moon.”\\n\\n“I thought you saw her after the Thraxxis War,” Human-Amir pointed out, and wiggled away from his overly-tolerant grandfather. “I mean, from a distance. I was on the *India* for that.”\\n\\n“I was on Occupied Ha’reet, defending my Pride.”\\n\\nThey entered another sprawling set of apartments, these rooms filled with a number of people who looked very much like Human-Amir and Human-Luka. \\n\\nHuman-Amir made straight towards a happy, although tired-looking, woman who might easily have been his twin for how much they looked alike. \\n\\n“Hi Hina,” he said, and kissed her cheek before making something he called ‘grabby hands’ at the tiny bundle in her arms. “Baby. Gimme.”\\n\\n“Wretch,” the woman, who could only be his older sister, Sahina and the mother of the child in question, said, and surrendered her tiny kit with only a little hesitation. “Remember to support his head.”\\n\\n“It hasn’t been *that* long since I held a baby,” Human-Amir complained, and cradled the child in his arms before returning to Vree’s side to show off his tiny, cooing prize. “I remember when Maggie was born. Lookit Vree. He’s the cutest little bug.”\\n\\nThe child was indeed adorable, as baby animals tended to be, and Vree leaned down to blink slowly at the child. The baby peered up at him through blue eyes, and immediately sneezed on his snout. \\n\\n“Definitely related to you,” he told Human-Amir, while wiping his nose carefully. To Sahina, he bowed the human way. “Congratulations on your kit. He is indeed adorable.”\\n\\n“Thank you,” Sahina beamed, and watched as Al’Mudhib claimed the baby next, ignoring Human-Amir’s protests that he wasn’t done. “Now all he has to do is survive our family.” \\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\nIf you like this, check out my masterlist at r/LeeHadanWrites',\n",

       "   'selftext': ' \\n\\nLike most stories, this one begins with three idiots sitting in a room full of aliens. FISTAHAT, the First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques, was the most prestigious damn music (and art) school in the galaxy, and we still had to sit through orientation. Most orientations however were boring. FISTAHAT’s New Species orientation was supposed to be all about welcoming members of the newest species who made it in. \\n\\nAnd Mankind was very new.\\n\\n“Welcome to NS Orientation,” the large, friendly pile of gray-green tentacles spluttered into the mic. “I am your professor, Laibach. You may call me Teach.\\n\\nI smiled. A professor who allowed us to call him Teach didn’t seem too bad. If I remembered correctly, this species was- damn, I forgot what it was.\\n\\n“In a moment, you will be paired up with some older students. You will spend the day together, and they will help you acclimate to your new situation. These ‘Buddies’ will help you learn the ropes of campus life”\\n\\nCool. As I looked at the various aliens clustered at the front of the room, I saw that some looked weird as hell, all limbs and mouths while others looked pretty normal; some even set my hormones a’rumblin’. \\n\\n“I’ll give you a moment or two to meet your buddies,” Teach bubbled and splattered. “If you’ll reach under your seats, you’ll find a number. Find whomever has the matching number.”\\n\\nI reached beneath my seat and pulled off the piece of paper tucked in the lining. Twelve. We all got up and milled around the room. \\n\\n“What do you got?” I asked a mouth with legs. It opened its mouth to reveal a three-pronged tongue wrapped around a slobber-soaked note: Thirteen. Mouthlegs walked away to greener pastures. I came across a curvy green chick with a big scaly crest on her head. She was wrapped in some kind of flimsy fabric that shimmered in pearlescent colors. Fuck yeah.\\n\\n“Twelve?” she hissed. \\n\\n“Yeah, that’s me.” I showed her the number.\\n\\n“I Thiria,” she tried to hiss in English while sitting back down. English was notoriously bitchy to speak for members of the Galactic Union. Of course, Gal-Standard was just as hard for the human mouth.\\n\\n“Mike,” I replied.\\n\\n“Pike.” Her hard lips stumbled over the word. “Nape is difficult.” \\n\\nAh yes, the classic *M* problem. A maddening motherfucker of a mess, this mass malady muddled many, or maybe most members of the GU. Few races could pronounce that damn letter. There was a good reason we all relied on the translator fog: a cloud of sentient bacteria all connected to everybodys’ nervous systems, translating their communication methods between people. Didn’t do anything for names though. Thiria reengaged her fog and sat back.\\n\\n“I think we’re going to be using the Fog a lot this year,” she said. “Thought I would try English,” she said. “Guess it didn’t work out too well. Thiria.” She held out a scaly green hand with, I noticed, three fingers and a fourth further back on the wrist. I shook it. I looked for any sign of body language but didn’t see anything, save for a forked tongue darting out of her mouth every now and then. Maybe she was sniffing the air, like a snake.\\n\\n“Mike.”\\n\\n“Now that you’ve had a chance to get together with your partners, get back together with the members of your species. You will find a piece of art. If your species is capable of music you may choose that. This art is something that represents your species.”\\n\\nI looked over at my roommates. As the first four members of the GU’s newest race, we represented all of Mankind. So naturally we should have chosen something big and classic; something something Bach, Mozart, Copeland. So of course I went to my phone and pulled up the classics: Queen, Iron Maiden, you know. Good stuff.\\n\\n\"Dammit, Kevin,\" I snapped over at Crackhead Kevin. \"Stop flirting with the Skeko chicks, we have to think about this!\"\\n\\n\"Sorry, bro,\" he turned his attention to the task at hand.\\n\\n“How ‘bout this?” I grinned as I put on Tequila, by the Champs. We all howled with laughter as the sax line came along. \\n\\n“No, no,” Crackhead Kevin grinned. The skinny bastard pulled up a video on his phone, and I momentarily reflected how great it was that the Galactic Union had connected their Galnet to the internet for uninterrupted access. “*This!*” Something, by the Butthole Surfers, came over his phone. “But a live version!” On the screen, Gibby Haynes blasted on the tuba in between the lyrics he was screaming. “Something she said to me last night! Something she said to me!”\\n\\n“Seriously, though,” my other roommate, Jim, asked, his sandy hair flopping up and down as he talked. “Maybe something that has some sort of message?” He put on Won’t Get Fooled Again, by the Who. By the time Keith Moon yelled his famous YEAH, we were all hooked.\\n\\nBrick, my third roommate, sat there, catatonic, his enormous form crammed into the tiny chair.. We waited around for Teach to call someone up.\\n\\n“Time!” the pile of tentacles said. “Who wants to go first?”\\n\\n“We will!” A pair of busty Antath girls walked to the front of the room. If I remembered my aliens correctly, the Antath were the ones who came across Earth in the first place when one of their NoSpace scouts accidentally rammed into the ISS. “I’m Gadda,” she said, her head tentacles rippling as she talked, “And this is Vida. And we have a hymn asking the Skymother to watch over us.”\\n\\n“In-a-gadda-da-vida,” Brick sang quietly as the song started. We all struggled to hold in out laughter as the beautiful strings and harmonious voices filled the room.\\n\\n“Bravo!” Teach gushed as the song finished with a flute concerto. “What a perfect piece! Why do you say it represents the Antath?”\\n\\n“Well,” Gadda, or maybe Vida said. “We are all children of the Skymother, and it helps us all when we recognise this.”\\n\\n“Wonderful! We can tell that the Antath are a deeply religious people. Now who’s next? You?” He pointed at something like a disembodied hand with centipede legs. The palm had a mouth in it. It scuttled forwards and hopped onto the podium. A painting popped up on the screen, and the hand critter pointed at various parts and gibbered and burped. Perhaps I needed my connection to the fog adjusted.\\n\\n\"I\\'ll go next,\" Thiria stood up and put on a song. Something like a Gregorian chant sung by lizards filled the room. When it was done, she went into a detailed description of how the song was carefully constructed to include only sounds and tones found pleasurable by her people. \\n\\n\"And anybody who\\'s been in the galactic community for long know that her people have contributed much to the field of discomfort and pain relief!\" Squeaked Teach. \"Excellent job. Next up. Hmm… You?” He pointed up at us. “You’re humans, right? Everybody,” Teach turned back to the class, “Humans are the newest members of the Galactic Union.” And with that tidbit, he turned back to us. \\n\\nWe all walked forwards, like a murderer walking the Green Mile, and clustered around the podium.\\n\\n“I’m Mike,” I said, “and these are Jim, Brick, and Cra- Kevin. Yes! Kevin. And we picked the song ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again,’ by the Who. It’s about how those in power don’t always have your best interests at heart.”\\n\\nAnd we started the song.\\n\\nAbout halfway through, I could tell it wasn’t going well. The Antath chicks were looking at the door, for starters. Mr. Hand seemed completely disinterested. Teach stopped the song halfway through.\\n\\n“What in the galaxy was that?” Somebody asked.\\n\\n“I understand that your race is new,\" Teach said in, presumably, a soothing voice, \"and you’re trying to make your whole species look good by claiming to have developed music,” He slapped his tentacles on the ground, “but noise and music are two different things.”\\n\\nWe didn’t really hear the rest of the class go through their things; we were far too pissed off.\\n\\nAs the class let out, we tried to sneak out under the eyes of everyone, but out buddies caught up with us.\\n\\n“Pike!” Thiria called excitedly as we made for the door.\\n\\n“Gotta go, guys.” I walked over. “What’s up?”\\n\\nShe switched her fog back on. “Want to get lunch?”\\n\\nI *was* getting a little hungry. “Sure. What’s good on campus?” I followed her out the door across the grounds. \\n\\n“Not much, honestly. I know you humans sometimes eat animal flesh, but the only place that sells that is…” She pointed at a foul-smelling shack piled high with carcasses.\\n\\n“Ehhh…” I contemplated. “Let’s see what we got in the way of vegetables.”\\n\\n“Ooooh, there’s a *great* Ryellian place just off campus!” she said. “My vehicle’s just over there!”\\n\\nWe quickly ran to the skimmer and got in. “You know,” she said, “That was really mean of Teach. I mean, most of the races all have the same-sounding music, but I guess somebody’s gotta be different.”\\n\\nI watched the city go by as we drove along. Our university, and the town that cropped up around it, had been built on a habitable moon orbiting a rocky planet. The weird blobby buildings zipped by, and soon Thiria pulled into the parking lot.\\n\\n“Ever gotten Ryellian?”\\n\\nI shook my head. \\n\\n“That means ‘no,’ right? It’s simple. You take your bowl, and put the green stuff in.” She shoveled some green paste into her bowl. “Then you pick some other stuff. That brown goo is sweet, and the blue balls are salty. The red stuff… Just don’t eat the red stuff. Hold on a moment” She pulled out her communicator and started speaking in her own language. It sounded like a lot of ‘S’ and ‘Th’ sounds.\\n\\nI did as she said and scooped in my helping of paste and balls. I grabbed a utensil like a two-pronged fork and sat down. I scooped some of the concoction into my mouth, and…\\n\\n“I don’t really know what to think.” It tasted like Prime Rib topped with Caesar Salad. It wasn’t necessarily *bad*, but prime rib and caesar salad didn’t go together.\\n\\n“Don’t tell them that,” Thiria pointed at a ferretlike creature, presumably, a Ryellian. “They take their food seriously.” She took another bite. “I suppose it’s kind of like your music. Everyone hated Ryellian food at first.” She passed her bowl to a robot that took it away. “You’re going to have to convince them that your music deserves respect.”\\n\\nThat was the problem, really? Jim, Crackhead Kevin, Brick and I were all rockers. We all loved that kind of music.\\n\\n“Do you play any instruments? Oh, and don’t worry about the check. I’ll cover it.”\\n\\n“Yeah, we all-” That was a great idea. “Hell yeah! Thanks for the help!”\\n\\n“What did I do?”\\n\\n“You just gave me the best idea. We- my roommates and I; we’re gonna start a band!” I gave her a quick hug.\\n\\n“No, that isn’t what- nevermind.” Thiria said, confused. “When you finish up, I’ll show you the meeting hall.”\\n\\n“So I have to ask,” I said as we walked out. “I only know the Antath and a few others-”\\n\\n“If you’re asking what species I am; there’s a better way. Let me see your phone.” She held out a three-fingered hand.\\n\\nI pulled out the gadget and unlocked it before passing it to her. \\n\\n“There’s an app,” she explained, “That can tell you what species someone is, plus some extra information.” She passed the phone back. “Try it out!”\\n\\nI pointed the camera at her. “Perlek?” I said, and pointed the camera at one of the ferrets. “And that’s a Ryellian. And that hand thingy over there is…” The app said *Unpronounceable.* \\n\\n“Yeah… Spog’s Creature is a weird one,” Thiria said. “But the other two were right.”\\n\\nI wasn’t really paying attention at this point; I had other priorities; specifically, observing how the thing she was wearing clung to her ass. “That’s good to know,” I said. “It would have been weird asking everyone what species they are.\\n\\n“Rude, too,” she said. We’re supposed to see beyond race. But it’s just so useful for identifying people.”\\n\\nWe drove in silence for a while before Thiria spoke again. \"So what are you planning on studying?\"\\n\\n\"I was hoping to go into music education. What about you?\"\\n\\nShe looked out the window with a huff. \"I wanted to study xenoarchaeology, but my parents wouldn\\'t have their only daughter digging in the dirt for relics. They wanted me to study *music!* Um,\" she looked at me, \"No offense.\"\\n\\n\"None taken. So what did you do?\"\\n\\n\"We compromised. I\\'m now studying xeno-aural theory,\" she laughed harshly and turned back onto University Boulevard.\\n\\n\"You\\'re not enjoying it?\"\\n\\n\"Well... not really. It\\'s the same, all across the Galactic Union. Every race, the same thing. Well, you heard it. That, for all three thousand races.\"\\n\\n\"That really sucks.\" I tried to think of earth, but there was only one kind of music.\\n\\n\"Which is why I think you and the other humans are so important to this college. You are in position to give something new to, um, not just the university, but the Galactic Union.\"\\n\\nAnd with that heavy thought, I said goodbye and got out of the skimmer.\\n\\n**Now**\\n\\nSupposedly in the ultraviolet that everybody else saw things in, this place was awash with colors but to human eyes it was boring and gray. We drank our beers and peered out the window overlooking First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques campus. It looked so peaceful; just a bunch of lights spreading out below us under the planet hanging in the night sky.\\n\\n“Fuck these guys,” I groaned as I cracked open another beer.  Nothing good, just a can of Shitty Lite.\\n\\n“Seriously, guys,” said Crackhead Kevin from on the floor. “No cool music, no drinking, no parties… The Galactic Union is the worst.” I pretty much agreed with him.\\n\\n“No phthfun,” I mushed through a mouthful of beer.\\n\\n“I was seriously hoping I could party it up with some of those Skeko girls down the hall,” he mumbled. “I wanted to take a crack at that alien crack.” This last statement of his dissolved into a fit of giggling.\\n\\nI thought about our squishy-looking, banana-yellow neighbors. “Do you- do you mean crack *drugs*?” I slurred, looking at the blazed, sweaty pothead on the floor, wreathed in smoke. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he had been talking about drugs. “Or crack… crack?” Crack had to be the most useless word ever, all the meanings it had. Crack drugs, crack… crack, crack women, crack news. It was stupid. Hell, crack the noise.\\n\\n“Alien chicks, man!” Crackhead Kevin spluttered with laughter and took another hit. “Gonna be the first human to bone ‘em!”\\n\\n“Very good, Kevin, but you ever see Species? Or Skinless? Or Beyond the Flesh?”\\n\\n“The [Skymen](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b497ny/the_skymen_chapter_one/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share),” Brick continued. “[Apes](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cd7dpp/apes_chapter_1_less_a_blast_from_the_past_more_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share)?\"\\n\\n“Hell, for all we know they got pussy teeth,” Jim said. \\n\\n“Did you see those- PAHAHAHAHA- Antath chicks in the orientation class? *Damn*, they had some boobs!” Crackhead Kevin continued before dissolving back into laughter.\\n\\nI sighed. The New Species College Orientation Class had been a shitshow. Ostensibly, the idea had been for members of species newly added to the Galactic Union to be paired up with members of the older races to help them get used to the GU. In practice…\\n\\n“Seriously, who thought going to an alien college was a good idea?” asked Jim. “Fuck the Galactic Union, fuck these stupid rules, and *fuck* FISTAHAT!”\\n\\nFISTAHAT was, supposedly the most prestigious music and art school in the whole damn galaxy, though it seemed they had their heads up their asses. I raised my bottle, though at this point my hand was swaying pretty bad. \"Fuck FISTAHAT!\"\\n\\n\"Hell yeah!\" Jim hollered. He and Brick clinked their bottles against mine. Crackhead Kevin raised a gaunt fist in the air.\\n\\n\"Woo!\" he said halfheartedly.\\n\\n“They have a *stupid* specific idea of what music is,” Brick mumbled. \\n\\n“You know,” I said. I searched for the vaguely beer-shaped mass in front of my eyes. Finding it, I took another drink. “My Buddy gave me an idea.”\\n\\n“Buddy?- shit,” Jim spilled my beer and leapt, sorry, flopped down to clean it up. From below the table he continued. “You mean that alien chick? The lizard girl?”\\n\\n“Oh yeah?” Brick asked before borrowing Kevin’s bowl.\\n\\n“We should start a band. I mean, Brick, you play the drums, and I took those voice lessons. Crack- *dammit*, Kevin and Jim play the guitar. We could be totally frikkin’ crack!”\\n\\n“You really think that’s a good idea?” Crackhead Kevin asked. “I mean, after today…”\\n\\n“That’s precisely why.” I liberated the bowl from Brick and took a massive hit. “You know,” I coughed, “We should save this stuff. I don’t know how long we’re gonna have to go without getting a new shipment. Same for the booze. I taste- hehehe- tasted that alien booze, it’s this nasty sugary stuff.” \\n\\n“Hmmm…” Brick got on his phone. “There’s a place we could perform. It’s in the meeting hall; every Friday they let a few bands and performers play.”\\n\\n“We talking Gimo’s?” Kevin asked. “My Buddy took me there. It’s sort of a coffee house, but different. You go there, get your drinks, and enjoy the arts. But it’s all about the arts.”\\n\\n“So it’s a coffee house.” Jim clarified.\\n\\nI got up and staggered to my room. Flipping on the lights, I grasped around for my mic and amp. “Class doesn’t start for a week, we should start practicing. Right after this nap.” I lay down on the carpet, amp in hand. At least the floor of our dorm was comfy.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like most stories, this one begins with three idiots sitting in a room full of aliens. FISTAHAT, the First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques, was the most prestigious damn music (and art) school in the galaxy, and we still had to sit through orientation. Most orientations however were boring. FISTAHAT’s New Species orientation was supposed to be all about welcoming members of the newest species who made it in. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And Mankind was very new.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Welcome to NS Orientation,” the large, friendly pile of gray-green tentacles spluttered into the mic. “I am your professor, Laibach. You may call me Teach.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I smiled. A professor who allowed us to call him Teach didn’t seem too bad. If I remembered correctly, this species was- damn, I forgot what it was.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“In a moment, you will be paired up with some older students. You will spend the day together, and they will help you acclimate to your new situation. These ‘Buddies’ will help you learn the ropes of campus life”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cool. As I looked at the various aliens clustered at the front of the room, I saw that some looked weird as hell, all limbs and mouths while others looked pretty normal; some even set my hormones a’rumblin’. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ll give you a moment or two to meet your buddies,” Teach bubbled and splattered. “If you’ll reach under your seats, you’ll find a number. Find whomever has the matching number.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I reached beneath my seat and pulled off the piece of paper tucked in the lining. Twelve. We all got up and milled around the room. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What do you got?” I asked a mouth with legs. It opened its mouth to reveal a three-pronged tongue wrapped around a slobber-soaked note: Thirteen. Mouthlegs walked away to greener pastures. I came across a curvy green chick with a big scaly crest on her head. She was wrapped in some kind of flimsy fabric that shimmered in pearlescent colors. Fuck yeah.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Twelve?” she hissed. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, that’s me.” I showed her the number.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I Thiria,” she tried to hiss in English while sitting back down. English was notoriously bitchy to speak for members of the Galactic Union. Of course, Gal-Standard was just as hard for the human mouth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mike,” I replied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Pike.” Her hard lips stumbled over the word. “Nape is difficult.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Ah yes, the classic &lt;em&gt;M&lt;/em&gt; problem. A maddening motherfucker of a mess, this mass malady muddled many, or maybe most members of the GU. Few races could pronounce that damn letter. There was a good reason we all relied on the translator fog: a cloud of sentient bacteria all connected to everybodys’ nervous systems, translating their communication methods between people. Didn’t do anything for names though. Thiria reengaged her fog and sat back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I think we’re going to be using the Fog a lot this year,” she said. “Thought I would try English,” she said. “Guess it didn’t work out too well. Thiria.” She held out a scaly green hand with, I noticed, three fingers and a fourth further back on the wrist. I shook it. I looked for any sign of body language but didn’t see anything, save for a forked tongue darting out of her mouth every now and then. Maybe she was sniffing the air, like a snake.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Mike.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Now that you’ve had a chance to get together with your partners, get back together with the members of your species. You will find a piece of art. If your species is capable of music you may choose that. This art is something that represents your species.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I looked over at my roommates. As the first four members of the GU’s newest race, we represented all of Mankind. So naturally we should have chosen something big and classic; something something Bach, Mozart, Copeland. So of course I went to my phone and pulled up the classics: Queen, Iron Maiden, you know. Good stuff.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dammit, Kevin,&amp;quot; I snapped over at Crackhead Kevin. &amp;quot;Stop flirting with the Skeko chicks, we have to think about this!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sorry, bro,&amp;quot; he turned his attention to the task at hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“How ‘bout this?” I grinned as I put on Tequila, by the Champs. We all howled with laughter as the sax line came along. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, no,” Crackhead Kevin grinned. The skinny bastard pulled up a video on his phone, and I momentarily reflected how great it was that the Galactic Union had connected their Galnet to the internet for uninterrupted access. “&lt;em&gt;This!&lt;/em&gt;” Something, by the Butthole Surfers, came over his phone. “But a live version!” On the screen, Gibby Haynes blasted on the tuba in between the lyrics he was screaming. “Something she said to me last night! Something she said to me!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, though,” my other roommate, Jim, asked, his sandy hair flopping up and down as he talked. “Maybe something that has some sort of message?” He put on Won’t Get Fooled Again, by the Who. By the time Keith Moon yelled his famous YEAH, we were all hooked.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Brick, my third roommate, sat there, catatonic, his enormous form crammed into the tiny chair.. We waited around for Teach to call someone up.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Time!” the pile of tentacles said. “Who wants to go first?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We will!” A pair of busty Antath girls walked to the front of the room. If I remembered my aliens correctly, the Antath were the ones who came across Earth in the first place when one of their NoSpace scouts accidentally rammed into the ISS. “I’m Gadda,” she said, her head tentacles rippling as she talked, “And this is Vida. And we have a hymn asking the Skymother to watch over us.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“In-a-gadda-da-vida,” Brick sang quietly as the song started. We all struggled to hold in out laughter as the beautiful strings and harmonious voices filled the room.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Bravo!” Teach gushed as the song finished with a flute concerto. “What a perfect piece! Why do you say it represents the Antath?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Well,” Gadda, or maybe Vida said. “We are all children of the Skymother, and it helps us all when we recognise this.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wonderful! We can tell that the Antath are a deeply religious people. Now who’s next? You?” He pointed at something like a disembodied hand with centipede legs. The palm had a mouth in it. It scuttled forwards and hopped onto the podium. A painting popped up on the screen, and the hand critter pointed at various parts and gibbered and burped. Perhaps I needed my connection to the fog adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll go next,&amp;quot; Thiria stood up and put on a song. Something like a Gregorian chant sung by lizards filled the room. When it was done, she went into a detailed description of how the song was carefully constructed to include only sounds and tones found pleasurable by her people. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;And anybody who&amp;#39;s been in the galactic community for long know that her people have contributed much to the field of discomfort and pain relief!&amp;quot; Squeaked Teach. &amp;quot;Excellent job. Next up. Hmm… You?” He pointed up at us. “You’re humans, right? Everybody,” Teach turned back to the class, “Humans are the newest members of the Galactic Union.” And with that tidbit, he turned back to us. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We all walked forwards, like a murderer walking the Green Mile, and clustered around the podium.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m Mike,” I said, “and these are Jim, Brick, and Cra- Kevin. Yes! Kevin. And we picked the song ‘Won’t Get Fooled Again,’ by the Who. It’s about how those in power don’t always have your best interests at heart.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And we started the song.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;About halfway through, I could tell it wasn’t going well. The Antath chicks were looking at the door, for starters. Mr. Hand seemed completely disinterested.

What’s good on campus?” I followed her out the door across the grounds. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Not much, honestly. I know you humans sometimes eat animal flesh, but the only place that sells that is…” She pointed at a foul-smelling shack piled high with carcasses.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ehhh…” I contemplated. “Let’s see what we got in the way of vegetables.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ooooh, there’s a &lt;em&gt;great&lt;/em&gt; Ryellian place just off campus!” she said. “My vehicle’s just over there!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We quickly ran to the skimmer and got in. “You know,” she said, “That was really mean of Teach. I mean, most of the races all have the same-sounding music, but I guess somebody’s gotta be different.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I watched the city go by as we drove along. Our university, and the town that cropped up around it, had been built on a habitable moon orbiting a rocky planet. The weird blobby buildings zipped by, and soon Thiria pulled into the parking lot.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Ever gotten Ryellian?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I shook my head. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That means ‘no,’ right? It’s simple. You take your bowl, and put the green stuff in.” She shoveled some green paste into her bowl. “Then you pick some other stuff. That brown goo is sweet, and the blue balls are salty. The red stuff… Just don’t eat the red stuff. Hold on a moment” She pulled out her communicator and started speaking in her own language. It sounded like a lot of ‘S’ and ‘Th’ sounds.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I did as she said and scooped in my helping of paste and balls. I grabbed a utensil like a two-pronged fork and sat down. I scooped some of the concoction into my mouth, and…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I don’t really know what to think.” It tasted like Prime Rib topped with Caesar Salad. It wasn’t necessarily &lt;em&gt;bad&lt;/em&gt;, but prime rib and caesar salad didn’t go together.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Don’t tell them that,” Thiria pointed at a ferretlike creature, presumably, a Ryellian. “They take their food seriously.” She took another bite. “I suppose it’s kind of like your music. Everyone hated Ryellian food at first.” She passed her bowl to a robot that took it away. “You’re going to have to convince them that your music deserves respect.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That was the problem, really? Jim, Crackhead Kevin, Brick and I were all rockers. We all loved that kind of music.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Do you play any instruments? Oh, and don’t worry about the check. I’ll cover it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah, we all-” That was a great idea. “Hell yeah! Thanks for the help!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What did I do?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You just gave me the best idea. We- my roommates and I; we’re gonna start a band!” I gave her a quick hug.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No, that isn’t what- nevermind.” Thiria said, confused. “When you finish up, I’ll show you the meeting hall.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So I have to ask,” I said as we walked out. “I only know the Antath and a few others-”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you’re asking what species I am; there’s a better way. Let me see your phone.” She held out a three-fingered hand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pulled out the gadget and unlocked it before passing it to her. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“There’s an app,” she explained, “That can tell you what species someone is, plus some extra information.” She passed the phone back. “Try it out!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pointed the camera at her. “Perlek?” I said, and pointed the camera at one of the ferrets. “And that’s a Ryellian. And that hand thingy over there is…” The app said &lt;em&gt;Unpronounceable.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yeah… Spog’s Creature is a weird one,” Thiria said. “But the other two were right.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wasn’t really paying attention at this point; I had other priorities; specifically, observing how the thing she was wearing clung to her ass. “That’s good to know,” I said. “It would have been weird asking everyone what species they are.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Rude, too,” she said. We’re supposed to see beyond race. But it’s just so useful for identifying people.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;We drove in silence for a while before Thiria spoke again. &amp;quot;So what are you planning on studying?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I was hoping to go into music education. What about you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She looked out the window with a huff. &amp;quot;I wanted to study xenoarchaeology, but my parents wouldn&amp;#39;t have their only daughter digging in the dirt for relics. They wanted me to study &lt;em&gt;music!&lt;/em&gt; Um,&amp;quot; she looked at me, &amp;quot;No offense.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;None taken. So what did you do?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We compromised. I&amp;#39;m now studying xeno-aural theory,&amp;quot; she laughed harshly and turned back onto University Boulevard.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You&amp;#39;re not enjoying it?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well... not really. It&amp;#39;s the same, all across the Galactic Union. Every race, the same thing. Well, you heard it. That, for all three thousand races.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That really sucks.&amp;quot; I tried to think of earth, but there was only one kind of music.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Which is why I think you and the other humans are so important to this college. You are in position to give something new to, um, not just the university, but the Galactic Union.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And with that heavy thought, I said goodbye and got out of the skimmer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Supposedly in the ultraviolet that everybody else saw things in, this place was awash with colors but to human eyes it was boring and gray. We drank our beers and peered out the window overlooking First Interstellar School for Teaching Aural Harmonies And Techniques campus. It looked so peaceful; just a bunch of lights spreading out below us under the planet hanging in the night sky.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Fuck these guys,” I groaned as I cracked open another beer.  Nothing good, just a can of Shitty Lite.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, guys,” said Crackhead Kevin from on the floor. “No cool music, no drinking, no parties… The Galactic Union is the worst.” I pretty much agreed with him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“No phthfun,” I mushed through a mouthful of beer.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I was seriously hoping I could party it up with some of those Skeko girls down the hall,” he mumbled. “I wanted to take a crack at that alien crack.” This last statement of his dissolved into a fit of giggling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I thought about our squishy-looking, banana-yellow neighbors. “Do you- do you mean crack &lt;em&gt;drugs&lt;/em&gt;?” I slurred, looking at the blazed, sweaty pothead on the floor, wreathed in smoke. I wouldn’t have been surprised if he had been talking about drugs. “Or crack… crack?” Crack had to be the most useless word ever, all the meanings it had. Crack drugs, crack… crack, crack women, crack news. It was stupid. Hell, crack the noise.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Alien chicks, man!” Crackhead Kevin spluttered with laughter and took another hit. “Gonna be the first human to bone ‘em!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Very good, Kevin, but you ever see Species? Or Skinless? Or Beyond the Flesh?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/b497ny/the_skymen_chapter_one/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Skymen&lt;/a&gt;,” Brick continued. “&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cd7dpp/apes_chapter_1_less_a_blast_from_the_past_more_a/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Apes&lt;/a&gt;?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hell, for all we know they got pussy teeth,” Jim said. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Did you see those- PAHAHAHAHA- Antath chicks in the orientation class? &lt;em&gt;Damn&lt;/em&gt;, they had some boobs!” Crackhead Kevin continued before dissolving back into laughter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I sighed. The New Species College Orientation Class had been a shitshow. Ostensibly, the idea had been for members of species newly added to the Galactic Union to be paired up with members of the older races to help them get used to the GU. In practice…&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Seriously, who thought going to an alien college was a good idea?” asked Jim. “Fuck the Galactic Union, fuck these stupid rules, and &lt;em&gt;fuck&lt;/em&gt; FISTAHAT!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;FISTAHAT was, supposedly the most prestigious music and art school in the whole damn galaxy, though it seemed they had their heads up their asses. I raised my bottle, though at this point my hand was swaying pretty bad. &amp;quot;Fuck FISTAHAT!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hell yeah!&amp;quot; Jim hollered. He and Brick clinked their bottles against mine. Crackhead Kevin raised a gaunt fist in the air.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Woo!&amp;quot; he said halfheartedly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They have a &lt;em&gt;stupid&lt;/em&gt; specific idea of what music is,” Brick mumbled. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You know,” I said. I searched for the vaguely beer-shaped mass in front of my eyes. Finding it, I took another drink. “My Buddy gave me an idea.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Buddy?- shit,” Jim spilled my beer and leapt, sorry, flopped down to clean it up. From below the table he continued. “You mean that alien chick? The lizard girl?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Oh yeah?” Brick asked before borrowing Kevin’s bowl.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We should start a band. I mean, Brick, you play the drums, and I took those voice lessons. Crack- &lt;em&gt;dammit&lt;/em&gt;, Kevin and Jim play the guitar. We could be totally frikkin’ crack!”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You really think that’s a good idea?” Crackhead Kevin asked. “I mean, after today…”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“That’s precisely why.” I liberated the bowl from Brick and took a massive hit. “You know,” I coughed, “We should save this stuff. I don’t know how long we’re gonna have to go without getting a new shipment. Same for the booze. I taste- hehehe- tasted that alien booze, it’s this nasty sugary stuff.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Hmmm…” Brick got on his phone. “There’s a place we could perform. It’s in the meeting hall; every Friday they let a few bands and performers play.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“We talking Gimo’s?” Kevin asked. “My Buddy took me there. It’s sort of a coffee house, but different. You go there, get your drinks, and enjoy the arts. But it’s all about the arts.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So it’s a coffee house.” Jim clarified.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I got up and staggered to my room. Flipping on the lights, I grasped around for my mic and amp. “Class doesn’t start for a week, we should start practicing. Right after this nap.” I lay down on the carpet, amp in hand. At least the floor of our dorm was comfy.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': ' (*I need the cross-crank again*.) Andra held out a hand expectantly and was pleased to felt the familiar handle land in her palm without hesitation. (Thanks.\\n\\n(*This is surprisingly calming*,) Cygnus replied as he worked busily on a panel nearby. He was between meetings, and had taken to coming down to help her with her ship whenever he had some free time. Andra still hadn’t figured out why, and he still hadn’t deigned to answer when she asked. (*Is that why you’re always down here*?)\\n\\nThey were far enough away from each other that they would have had to yell. Fortunately, Cygnus was more than powerful enough to hold a mental conversation link between them, even when they were both focused on separate, intricate, tasks.\\n\\n(*I’m always down here because I would really rather not be noticed by anyone important*,) Andra told him dryly, and heard him snort from the other side of the ship. (*Besides you, anyway. Why do you think I haven’t told anyone I saw your vision?*)\\n\\n(*I assumed it spooked you,*) Cygnus said, not exactly hesitant, but aware of her discomfort about the matter. They hadn’t discussed the vision at all. (*High-level precognition is rare, and mine can be… overwhelming, even when the subject isn’t as distressing as this was. Also, I need the crank back unless you want me to risk ripping this panel off entirely*.)\\n\\nHis telekinesis was as powerful as his other gifts, but that much power often had control limitations.\\xa0\\n\\nHe could probably crack a moon in half, if he was willing to burn himself out to do it. But lift a teacup, or screw in a bolt? Completely beyond his abilities.\\n\\nNot for the first time, Andra was glad that her own telekinesis was so minor. She might not be able to do the big stuff, but the little stuff was usually more useful.\\n\\nShe wrenched three more bolts into place and floated the crank back to him with a thought. He caught it easily and began unscrewing the panel with quick pulls. (*I’ll need you here in a moment. This is more complicated than I can learn and do at the same time.*)\\n\\n(*One minute*.)\\n\\nAndra finished with her bolts and slid out from under the ship. Her coveralls were spattered with oil and space dust, and she wiped off her hands before she joined Cygnus at the panel. A large orb of woven wires, insulation, papers, and buts of plastic dominated most of the interior “Crap. That looks like a chimma nest.”\\n\\nIt was jarring to go from mental speech to verbal, but the connection still buzzed between them, carrying images and concepts that made the words come easier.\\n\\n“Chimmas?” He kept his hands well away from the woven next of wires and insulation even as Andra eyed it, mind flavored heavily with irritation at the previous owner of the ship. “What are chimmas?”\\n\\n“Little, annoying,” Andra summed up, grumbling even as she dug in her tool chest for the tough syn-leather gloves she kept handy. “Can bite through just about anything. They’d be cute, if they didn’t destroy wiring so fast.”\\n\\nShe grabbed a bucket and set it under the nest. Slime poured out as she began scraping the nest out of the wiring cavity. Tiny glowing rodents scattered in every direction and she caught as many as she could before they could escape.\\xa0\\n\\nCygnus was appalled, and a little disgusted as slime and wiring drizzled off her gloves and into the bucket. “This thing is a death trap. How is *this* the ship your Edge Leader chose to get here?”\\n\\n“I’m one of the best pilots we have,” Andra said, and cursed when one of the chimmas decided to go on the attack. She batted it into the bucket with more force than was strictly necessary, and it chittered at her furiously with the rest of its’ kind. “And my ship might be beat up, but it’s *mine*, free and clear.”\\n\\n“You *paid* for this flying death trap?”\\xa0\\n\\nCygnus was growing significantly more horrified by the moment. Andra flicked a chimma at him and had the distinct pleasure of watching him scramble to catch it, before he managed to scrape it off him and into the bucket with the others.\\n\\n“Yes, I paid for it,” Andra told him, and sighed when she got the last of the nest out of the wiring. “I saved for months to buy this ship. Don’t knock it. Close that up, yeah?”\\n\\n“You know I’m the most powerful Psion on Vega Base, right?” Cygnus said darkly, but he tapped the bucket lid down when she pointed at it. “I could explode your head with a thought.”\\n\\n“If you’re gonna, you’re gonna,” Andra told him and eyed the panel considering, before reaching in with her limited telekinesis. One by one, she diverted the almost-microscopic converters from the damaged wiring until the panel lit up a healthy green. When she turned around, he was staring at her, with an odd color to his mental ‘presence’ in her head. “What?”\\n\\n“What you just did,” he said, and leaned in close to the panel to examine the converters. “You said you were tested, yes?”\\n\\n“Precog and ‘path,” Andra confirmed, and decided that she could work and figure him out at the same time. With most of the chimmas contained, it was safe to close up. “Why? Cyg, you’re being weird.”\\n\\n“Were you tested on telekinesis too?”\\xa0\\n\\nHe was watching her closely, and Andra finally turned to give him her full attention. “No, I’ve never been able to lift more than a few pounds.”\\n\\n“It’s not all about weight,” Cygnus said slowly, and waved a hand. Her whole ship lifted off the ground weightlessly. “Who tested you?”\\n\\n“Lyr Kort, on Asteroid Base forty-two,” Andra said dubiously. “He tested all the Edge kids who showed any sign of Psi abilities. He got me into pilot training.”\\n\\n“He’s a hack,” Cygnus muttered, and sighed when he felt her confusion. Among his other abilities was low-grade Empathy, for all that he rarely used it. “Andra, micro-manipulation takes *more* power than macro-manipulation. It’s much harder to move very small things than it is to move big ones.”\\n\\n“It’s not a big deal,” she defended herself uncomfortably, and pulled off her gloves. “I mean, it’s useful, but-“\\n\\n“You don’t understand,” Cygnus said. Excitement tugged at the edges of his mind. “Compatible minds always have paired abilities, or they run the risk of burning each other out when they go into syzygy. I have *macro* telekinesis in spades, but my micro telekinesis is nonexistent. I explode things, usually. But you- if you’re doing electro-mechanical adjustments with your micro, your abilities are off the charts.”\\n\\n“You’ve got to be kidding,” Andra said, and leaned against her tool chest to consider what he was saying more seriously. On one hand, he was the leader of the psionic mercenary group, and probably knew what he was talking about. On the other… “What about my ‘path abilities? Still crap.”\\n\\n“You’re probably a receiver, not a projector,” Cygnus said thoughtfully, although he still had interesting bursts of excitement going off in his mind. Andra thought he was probably blowing things out of proportion a little. “Easy enough to test, when Ursa goes back to the capital. Now that I know you’re out here, I can reach for you, and if you can hear me, that will prove it.”\\n\\n“I’ve never heard of being a ‘receiving telepath’,” Andra told him dubiously, although her education as an Asteroid-Base orphan and grease monkey left plenty of education to be desired. There was only so much she could learn on her own in her spare time. “I can tell you for sure that my precog isn’t as strong as yours.”\\n\\n“Different doesn’t mean weaker,” Cygnus muttered, and scanned through his memory, fitting puzzle pieces together at light speed. “I bet yours is more reliable than mine, even if you don’t see as far ahead. You saw what mine looks like, and didn’t lose yourself in it. Point of fact, you pulled me *out.”*\\n\\n“Is that odd?” She wouldn’t know. Almost no one in the Edge Revolution had serious precog. They tended to go insane.\\n\\nThat might explain some of Cygnus being so weird.\\xa0\\n\\n“I heard that,” he told her, but he was too pleased with himself and her to care. “I’ve never been in syzygy with anyone during a precognitive incident.”\\n\\n“It sounds so *fancy* when you say it like that.”\\n\\n“Just because I’m using the correct language-“\\n\\nWhatever else he was going to say froze on his tongue as that same, terrible, yawning pit opened in his mind.\\n\\nAndra only had a moment to anchor herself in her own *self* before Cygnus was falling away into the vision, gasping for breath and already starting to seize. Blackness devoured the hanger port and the ship until there was nothing but stars and open space around them.\\n\\nA ship, oddly smooth and laden with weapons loomed over a glowing blue planet.\\n\\nA single rocket, tiny, compared to the ship, left a comet trail as it fired down, and vanished through the clouds far below, and billowed a perfect, terrifying circle though the soft white.\\n\\nThere was no sound, but Andra wished there was. The silence was almost worse as a shockwave rippled outward from the planet and hit them like a drum inside their chests. The force of it almost shook her loose, but Andra held onto her anchor and Cygnus determinedly, unwilling to lose either of them in the vision.\\n\\nFor a long moment after the shockwave faded, everything was absolutely still.\\n\\nAnd then deep, fire-lined cracks appeared blazing red-orange against all that blue.\\n\\nSpouts of molten stone shot into space in every direction, creating vast pillars as they hit the cold of space, but the eruption on the surface continued, viciously exploding continent after continent away into the black, still glowing with the heat of a fiery planet core.\\n\\nLimed by the death of a planet, something on the massive ship *noticed* them, and suddenly Andra was drowning in raw, directed *hatred*.\\n\\n(Hold on,) Cygnus whispered in their mind, and gathered himself. Andra showed him the anchor she held them by, and felt him understand.\\xa0\\n\\nWith a hard push against the vision, they were out, breathing hard on the greasy floor of the hanger.\\n\\n“They’re coming for us,” Cygnus rasped, and struggled to his feet, before helping Andra to hers. “We have to tell command.”\\n\\n“So much for staying under the radar,” Andra said, and steeled herself before she nodded firmly. “Okay. Let’s go.”\\n\\n\\\\+++\\n\\nIf you like this and want more, check out my masterlist at r/LeeHadanWrites',\n",

Andra held out a hand expectantly and was pleased to felt the familiar handle land in her palm without hesitation. (Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;This is surprisingly calming&lt;/em&gt;,) Cygnus replied as he worked busily on a panel nearby. He was between meetings, and had taken to coming down to help her with her ship whenever he had some free time. Andra still hadn’t figured out why, and he still hadn’t deigned to answer when she asked. (&lt;em&gt;Is that why you’re always down here&lt;/em&gt;?)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;They were far enough away from each other that they would have had to yell. Fortunately, Cygnus was more than powerful enough to hold a mental conversation link between them, even when they were both focused on separate, intricate, tasks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I’m always down here because I would really rather not be noticed by anyone important&lt;/em&gt;,) Andra told him dryly, and heard him snort from the other side of the ship. (&lt;em&gt;Besides you, anyway. Why do you think I haven’t told anyone I saw your vision?&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;I assumed it spooked you,&lt;/em&gt;) Cygnus said, not exactly hesitant, but aware of her discomfort about the matter. They hadn’t discussed the vision at all. (&lt;em&gt;High-level precognition is rare, and mine can be… overwhelming, even when the subject isn’t as distressing as this was. Also, I need the crank back unless you want me to risk ripping this panel off entirely&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;His telekinesis was as powerful as his other gifts, but that much power often had control limitations.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He could probably crack a moon in half, if he was willing to burn himself out to do it. But lift a teacup, or screw in a bolt? Completely beyond his abilities.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Not for the first time, Andra was glad that her own telekinesis was so minor. She might not be able to do the big stuff, but the little stuff was usually more useful.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She wrenched three more bolts into place and floated the crank back to him with a thought. He caught it easily and began unscrewing the panel with quick pulls. (&lt;em&gt;I’ll need you here in a moment. This is more complicated than I can learn and do at the same time.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;One minute&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Andra finished with her bolts and slid out from under the ship. Her coveralls were spattered with oil and space dust, and she wiped off her hands before she joined Cygnus at the panel. A large orb of woven wires, insulation, papers, and buts of plastic dominated most of the interior “Crap. That looks like a chimma nest.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It was jarring to go from mental speech to verbal, but the connection still buzzed between them, carrying images and concepts that made the words come easier.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Chimmas?” He kept his hands well away from the woven next of wires and insulation even as Andra eyed it, mind flavored heavily with irritation at the previous owner of the ship. “What are chimmas?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Little, annoying,” Andra summed up, grumbling even as she dug in her tool chest for the tough syn-leather gloves she kept handy. “Can bite through just about anything. They’d be cute, if they didn’t destroy wiring so fast.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;She grabbed a bucket and set it under the nest. Slime poured out as she began scraping the nest out of the wiring cavity. Tiny glowing rodents scattered in every direction and she caught as many as she could before they could escape.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cygnus was appalled, and a little disgusted as slime and wiring drizzled off her gloves and into the bucket. “This thing is a death trap. How is &lt;em&gt;this&lt;/em&gt; the ship your Edge Leader chose to get here?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’m one of the best pilots we have,” Andra said, and cursed when one of the chimmas decided to go on the attack. She batted it into the bucket with more force than was strictly necessary, and it chittered at her furiously with the rest of its’ kind. “And my ship might be beat up, but it’s &lt;em&gt;mine&lt;/em&gt;, free and clear.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You &lt;em&gt;paid&lt;/em&gt; for this flying death trap?”\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Cygnus was growing significantly more horrified by the moment. Andra flicked a chimma at him and had the distinct pleasure of watching him scramble to catch it, before he managed to scrape it off him and into the bucket with the others.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Yes, I paid for it,” Andra told him, and sighed when she got the last of the nest out of the wiring. “I saved for months to buy this ship. Don’t knock it. Close that up, yeah?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You know I’m the most powerful Psion on Vega Base, right?” Cygnus said darkly, but he tapped the bucket lid down when she pointed at it. “I could explode your head with a thought.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“If you’re gonna, you’re gonna,” Andra told him and eyed the panel considering, before reaching in with her limited telekinesis. One by one, she diverted the almost-microscopic converters from the damaged wiring until the panel lit up a healthy green. When she turned around, he was staring at her, with an odd color to his mental ‘presence’ in her head. “What?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What you just did,” he said, and leaned in close to the panel to examine the converters. “You said you were tested, yes?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Precog and ‘path,” Andra confirmed, and decided that she could work and figure him out at the same time. With most of the chimmas contained, it was safe to close up. “Why? Cyg, you’re being weird.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Were you tested on telekinesis too?”\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He was watching her closely, and Andra finally turned to give him her full attention. “No, I’ve never been able to lift more than a few pounds.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s not all about weight,” Cygnus said slowly, and waved a hand. Her whole ship lifted off the ground weightlessly. “Who tested you?”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Lyr Kort, on Asteroid Base forty-two,” Andra said dubiously. “He tested all the Edge kids who showed any sign of Psi abilities. He got me into pilot training.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“He’s a hack,” Cygnus muttered, and sighed when he felt her confusion. Among his other abilities was low-grade Empathy, for all that he rarely used it. “Andra, micro-manipulation takes &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; power than macro-manipulation. It’s much harder to move very small things than it is to move big ones.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s not a big deal,” she defended herself uncomfortably, and pulled off her gloves. “I mean, it’s useful, but-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You don’t understand,” Cygnus said. Excitement tugged at the edges of his mind. “Compatible minds always have paired abilities, or they run the risk of burning each other out when they go into syzygy. I have &lt;em&gt;macro&lt;/em&gt; telekinesis in spades, but my micro telekinesis is nonexistent. I explode things, usually. But you- if you’re doing electro-mechanical adjustments with your micro, your abilities are off the charts.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’ve got to be kidding,” Andra said, and leaned against her tool chest to consider what he was saying more seriously. On one hand, he was the leader of the psionic mercenary group, and probably knew what he was talking about. On the other… “What about my ‘path abilities? Still crap.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You’re probably a receiver, not a projector,” Cygnus said thoughtfully, although he still had interesting bursts of excitement going off in his mind. Andra thought he was probably blowing things out of proportion a little. “Easy enough to test, when Ursa goes back to the capital. Now that I know you’re out here, I can reach for you, and if you can hear me, that will prove it.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I’ve never heard of being a ‘receiving telepath’,” Andra told him dubiously, although her education as an Asteroid-Base orphan and grease monkey left plenty of education to be desired. There was only so much she could learn on her own in her spare time. “I can tell you for sure that my precog isn’t as strong as yours.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Different doesn’t mean weaker,” Cygnus muttered, and scanned through his memory, fitting puzzle pieces together at light speed. “I bet yours is more reliable than mine, even if you don’t see as far ahead. You saw what mine looks like, and didn’t lose yourself in it. Point of fact, you pulled me &lt;em&gt;out.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Is that odd?” She wouldn’t know. Almost no one in the Edge Revolution had serious precog. They tended to go insane.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;That might explain some of Cygnus being so weird.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I heard that,” he told her, but he was too pleased with himself and her to care. “I’ve never been in syzygy with anyone during a precognitive incident.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It sounds so &lt;em&gt;fancy&lt;/em&gt; when you say it like that.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Just because I’m using the correct language-“&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever else he was going to say froze on his tongue as that same, terrible, yawning pit opened in his mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Andra only had a moment to anchor herself in her own &lt;em&gt;self&lt;/em&gt; before Cygnus was falling away into the vision, gasping for breath and already starting to seize. Blackness devoured the hanger port and the ship until there was nothing but stars and open space around them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A ship, oddly smooth and laden with weapons loomed over a glowing blue planet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A single rocket, tiny, compared to the ship, left a comet trail as it fired down, and vanished through the clouds far below, and billowed a perfect, terrifying circle though the soft white.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was no sound, but Andra wished there was. The silence was almost worse as a shockwave rippled outward from the planet and hit them like a drum inside their chests. The force of it almost shook her loose, but Andra held onto her anchor and Cygnus determinedly, unwilling to lose either of them in the vision.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;For a long moment after the shockwave faded, everything was absolutely still.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And then deep, fire-lined cracks appeared blazing red-orange against all that blue.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Spouts of molten stone shot into space in every direction, creating vast pillars as they hit the cold of space, but the eruption on the surface continued, viciously exploding continent after continent away into the black, still glowing with the heat of a fiery planet core.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Limed by the death of a planet, something on the massive ship &lt;em&gt;noticed&lt;/em&gt; them, and suddenly Andra was drowning in raw, directed &lt;em&gt;hatred&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(Hold on,) Cygnus whispered in their mind, and gathered himself. Andra showed him the anchor she held them by, and felt him understand.\\xa0&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With a hard push against the vision, they were out, breathing hard on the greasy floor of the hanger.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“They’re coming for us,” Cygnus rasped, and struggled to his feet, before helping Andra to hers. “We have to tell command.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“So much for staying under the radar,” Andra said, and steeled herself before she nodded firmly. “Okay. Let’s go.”&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;+++&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If you like this and want more, check out my masterlist at &lt;a href=\"/r/LeeHadanWrites\"&gt;r/LeeHadanWrites&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

The dragon...my dragon? our dragon, now, ours as in our little group, ours as in all of humanity...she\\'s folded her wings and she stands there waiting with that strange maybe-bottomless patience of hers. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve finally found what I\\'ve been looking for, Kether. What my parents were looking for, all those years. What *dad* was looking for.\"\\n\\nHe winces and I know it\\'s unfair, that I\\'ve twisted a knife of special unkindness, but it\\'s the only one I can find right now and it\\'s a delicate moment, I don\\'t feel I should go into it unarmed. Kether and I aren\\'t blood, but he and my father were good as brothers. Better than most, really. I step forward and hold out my hand. \"Listen,\" I say, \"I know the risks, who better? Mom and Dad taught me everything they could, and you know damn well just how much that was. Yeah, sure, he\\'s serious danger. But it\\'s also serious *hope*, Kether, the first we\\'ve had in a long, long time. Since before I was born, probably, right?\"\\n\\nKether takes in a deep breath, and lets it out in slow irregular huffs. He doesn\\'t look at the dragon, though of course she\\'s right there in the peripheral of his sight, like he\\'s sure seeing her directly would be too much for his decision-making faculties. And maybe it would. He looks at my hand, instead, then walks forward and takes it in his own, huge almost-white palm and fingers just about engulfing my smaller near-black ones.  And he pulls me in for a quick hug, slapping me roughly on the back the way he always does, and as usual the smell and feel of him is comforting and a little sad, old memories of being held when I was smaller and Dad\\'s death was still fresh.\\n\\nI slap his broad back in return and step back, then step back again so I can look him in the eye without having to crane my neck too much. I\\'m not an especially short woman, about average, but he\\'s a giant of a man, and even though some of his bulk no longer comes from just muscle most of the muscle is still there. Dad says—used to say—that he\\'d seen Kether do some exceptional things, the kind of exceptional he never wanted to see again, back when they were more hotheaded and foolish and willing to take the fight directly to the fey.\\n\\n\"I haven\\'t named her yet.\" I don\\'t know why these are the first words to come to my mind and escape my lips, but they are and I glance over at her, but she\\'s still waiting, patient as living polished stone.\\n\\n\"She?\" Kether says, but he\\'s interrupted by a little girl, creeping out along the walls to stand just next to the dragon, small brown hand outstretched, caution warring curiosity in her dirty, delicate features.\\n\\n\"Can I touch her?\" the girl asks. I don\\'t know her name, I\\'m away from home too frequently and for too long to keep track of all the children who live here, I couldn\\'t really even tell you how many of them there are, I think there are something like three hundred of us in total?\\n\\n\"Sure,\" I say, the decision made in an instant and I\\'m not entirely sure just how momentous it might be, it feels like it is even though it\\'s just one child touching an ancient machine with no reason at all to harm her and why should that matter so much?\\n\\nBut it does, and I know it. We all know it, looking on.\\n\\n*Child is curious? Physical contact is no problem will do no harm to DRAGON unit, DRAGON unit does not harm human children by intention, this is absolute baseline instruction.*\\n\\nDragon does not harm *human* children. That gives me a small shudder. Maybe the part about intention should too, but I know enough about war to know that it doesn\\'t bound its horrors, the best of intentions can lead to the greatest of horrors and there\\'s nothing to do but go on, and maybe learn if you\\'re really lucky. So, okay, but...*human* children? We\\'re going to have to have a talk, she and I, after she\\'s named, after she\\'s introduced. \\n\\nThe little girl is still looking back and forth between me and the dragon, maybe because Kether has stepped forward as though ready to intervene. I give her a little nod.\\n\\nA small hand rests gently on the scintillating skin of a graceful neck. \"She\\'s so pretty,\" the girl whispers, then jumps back. \"She talked to me! In my head!\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" I say, and my voice seems like it\\'s coming from somewhere far away, from someone else maybe. \"That\\'s how she talks, usually.\"\\n\\n**Apologies,** comes the strange metallic voice for the second time. **DRAGON unit did not mean to startle. Child is welcome.**\\n\\nKether is staring, now, eyes wide, one of the few times I\\'ve ever seen him at a loss what to say or do. \"It speaks telepathically? Like an Elf Mage-Commander to her troops?\"\\n\\n\"She,\" I correct him, without even thinking about it. \"Yes. I was a little surprised to hear her say something out loud just now.\"\\n\\n**Audible sound not difficult. Vibrations in air at correct frequencies. Linguistic corrections more difficult. Have observed Operator Kella word-patterns, reconstructing local dialect with temporal drift.**\\n\\nKether laughs, soft and low. \"So you\\'re \\'Operator Kella\\' now? Does she see you as her owner, then?\"\\n\\nThe dragon ruffles her unfeathered wings, showing tiny scales that rise and smooth out on their surface instead. **Ownership is difficult concept, originally military weapon, military defunct Butlerian Empire fallen, Operator Kella recognized for initiative in seeking out DRAGON unit. Knowledge of old Empire plus DRAGON unit very high for new Dark Age. DRAGON unit is satisfied with arrangement does not wish to revise.**\\n\\nI\\'m touched, honestly, absurdly so, and I think this is the first time I\\'ve heard her actually express any sort of emotion or desire of her own, at least directly like that. \"Satisfied with arrangement.\" I suppose there are more eloquent ways to express that kind of sentiment—but I\\'ll take it just the same.\\n\\n\"Thanks,\" I say, loudly enough for everyone listening to hear, and I\\'m suddenly aware of the wider scope to this little drama, all the other faces gathered round, watching, remembering.\\n\\n*This is a legend,* I think, *someday parents will tell this story to their children, even if we fail people will remember this. I\\'m not sure if that makes me feel motivated or terrified. Probably plenty of both.*\\n\\n*Operator Kella will do well,* she sends back, and I suppose I should have realized she would catch all of that, I\\'m not exactly in a guarded moment. I send another thanks to her, silently this time, because I\\'ve also got to say something now, it\\'s expected, it\\'s right for the moment, and I\\'m not ready but\\n\\n*readiness is nice but now has the necessity*\\n\\nand I breathe in deep and let my gaze scan the little crowd, gathering larger every moment.\\n\\n\"I\\'m no good at speeches, I\\'m just a scavver really,\" I say. \"Speeches were Dad\\'s thing. Some of you knew him, a few others knew the kind of thing he and Mom were always looking for. Well, now I\\'ve found it. Found *her*. She still needs a name, but like I told Kether just a few moments ago, she\\'s the best hope we\\'ve had in a long, long time. We need to meet and talk about going forward. This place is fine for now but soon enough she\\'ll outgrow it, and we won\\'t evade fey notice for too long.\"\\n\\nI close my eyes, knowing I shouldn\\'t, I should project confidence in front of this crowd, this should be a legendary speech for a legendary beginning, but humanity gets what it gets, it gets me, I\\'ll just do my best and that\\'s all they can ask, all I can ask of myself.\\n\\n*That is all but best can improve, all can be added to, Operator Kella will have help grow with DRAGON unit not larger but other ways.*\\n\\nGods damn it all I\\'m sending again, but that\\'s alright, I send warmth back to her because that\\'s what the words give me and I don\\'t have time to process them right now even though they\\'re what I needed and I reach out, set my hand gently on the base of her neck, feeling what the little girl felt, surprisingly warm, dry and smooth-scaled.\\n\\nEveryone is still looking at me, not seeming to mind the pause. The moment overspills with possibility and I reach for one. It\\'s the only one, it\\'s an awful one, maybe no one left alive now knows how awful, we know the grind of oppression but this is a different kind of milling-stone I\\'m about to set in motion.\\n\\n\"We can no longer just do what we can from the shadows, we will still need secrecy and guile on our side but now, we are going to become something else, now we are going to have to do something else.\"\\n\\nI let my words sink in for a pause, purposeful this time, then stand up straight, fingers tightening on the base of her long neck, feeling that slight give, almost-living.\\n\\n\"Now, we go to war.\"\\n\\nKether\\'s eyes widen; I don\\'t have authority to declare anything like this, I don\\'t really have any authority at all. But I\\'ve said it, and people are listening, and I suppose that\\'s the only authority that really matters sometimes, and Kether\\'s about to speak but it\\'s cut off utterly.\\n\\nThe dragon roars.\\n\\nMy first thought, living here so long, is that it will attract the fey oh gods what are we going to do. But it won\\'t. No one knows what a dragon roar sounds like. Echoing down the streets, it could be one of their own half-tamed beasts making the noise. Certainly nothing human. Nothing to be concerned about.\\n\\nWell, they\\'ll know the sound soon enough. It\\'s an extraordinary one, somehow metallic, only that\\'s not quite right. Crystalline. Ringing through the air with little hints of inner fire.\\n\\nAnd the people roar back. That surprises me more. They roar their approval. They\\'re ready, maybe always have been, I don\\'t blame them, but I don\\'t think they know, I don\\'t think any of us do, just what\\'s coming, what it will mean.\\n\\nWar.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n*Continued soon*\\n\\n*come on by* r/Magleby *for plenty more stories while you wait.*',\n",

What &lt;em&gt;dad&lt;/em&gt; was looking for.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He winces and I know it&amp;#39;s unfair, that I&amp;#39;ve twisted a knife of special unkindness, but it&amp;#39;s the only one I can find right now and it&amp;#39;s a delicate moment, I don&amp;#39;t feel I should go into it unarmed. Kether and I aren&amp;#39;t blood, but he and my father were good as brothers. Better than most, really. I step forward and hold out my hand. &amp;quot;Listen,&amp;quot; I say, &amp;quot;I know the risks, who better? Mom and Dad taught me everything they could, and you know damn well just how much that was. Yeah, sure, he&amp;#39;s serious danger. But it&amp;#39;s also serious &lt;em&gt;hope&lt;/em&gt;, Kether, the first we&amp;#39;ve had in a long, long time. Since before I was born, probably, right?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether takes in a deep breath, and lets it out in slow irregular huffs. He doesn&amp;#39;t look at the dragon, though of course she&amp;#39;s right there in the peripheral of his sight, like he&amp;#39;s sure seeing her directly would be too much for his decision-making faculties. And maybe it would. He looks at my hand, instead, then walks forward and takes it in his own, huge almost-white palm and fingers just about engulfing my smaller near-black ones.  And he pulls me in for a quick hug, slapping me roughly on the back the way he always does, and as usual the smell and feel of him is comforting and a little sad, old memories of being held when I was smaller and Dad&amp;#39;s death was still fresh.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slap his broad back in return and step back, then step back again so I can look him in the eye without having to crane my neck too much. I&amp;#39;m not an especially short woman, about average, but he&amp;#39;s a giant of a man, and even though some of his bulk no longer comes from just muscle most of the muscle is still there. Dad says—used to say—that he&amp;#39;d seen Kether do some exceptional things, the kind of exceptional he never wanted to see again, back when they were more hotheaded and foolish and willing to take the fight directly to the fey.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I haven&amp;#39;t named her yet.&amp;quot; I don&amp;#39;t know why these are the first words to come to my mind and escape my lips, but they are and I glance over at her, but she&amp;#39;s still waiting, patient as living polished stone.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She?&amp;quot; Kether says, but he&amp;#39;s interrupted by a little girl, creeping out along the walls to stand just next to the dragon, small brown hand outstretched, caution warring curiosity in her dirty, delicate features.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Can I touch her?&amp;quot; the girl asks. I don&amp;#39;t know her name, I&amp;#39;m away from home too frequently and for too long to keep track of all the children who live here, I couldn&amp;#39;t really even tell you how many of them there are, I think there are something like three hundred of us in total?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sure,&amp;quot; I say, the decision made in an instant and I&amp;#39;m not entirely sure just how momentous it might be, it feels like it is even though it&amp;#39;s just one child touching an ancient machine with no reason at all to harm her and why should that matter so much?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But it does, and I know it. We all know it, looking on.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Child is curious? Physical contact is no problem will do no harm to DRAGON unit, DRAGON unit does not harm human children by intention, this is absolute baseline instruction.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Dragon does not harm &lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; children. That gives me a small shudder. Maybe the part about intention should too, but I know enough about war to know that it doesn&amp;#39;t bound its horrors, the best of intentions can lead to the greatest of horrors and there&amp;#39;s nothing to do but go on, and maybe learn if you&amp;#39;re really lucky. So, okay, but...&lt;em&gt;human&lt;/em&gt; children? We&amp;#39;re going to have to have a talk, she and I, after she&amp;#39;s named, after she&amp;#39;s introduced. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The little girl is still looking back and forth between me and the dragon, maybe because Kether has stepped forward as though ready to intervene. I give her a little nod.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A small hand rests gently on the scintillating skin of a graceful neck. &amp;quot;She&amp;#39;s so pretty,&amp;quot; the girl whispers, then jumps back. &amp;quot;She talked to me! In my head!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; I say, and my voice seems like it&amp;#39;s coming from somewhere far away, from someone else maybe. &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s how she talks, usually.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apologies,&lt;/strong&gt; comes the strange metallic voice for the second time. &lt;strong&gt;DRAGON unit did not mean to startle. Child is welcome.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether is staring, now, eyes wide, one of the few times I&amp;#39;ve ever seen him at a loss what to say or do. &amp;quot;It speaks telepathically? Like an Elf Mage-Commander to her troops?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She,&amp;quot; I correct him, without even thinking about it. &amp;quot;Yes. I was a little surprised to hear her say something out loud just now.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Audible sound not difficult. Vibrations in air at correct frequencies. Linguistic corrections more difficult. Have observed Operator Kella word-patterns, reconstructing local dialect with temporal drift.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether laughs, soft and low. &amp;quot;So you&amp;#39;re &amp;#39;Operator Kella&amp;#39; now? Does she see you as her owner, then?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dragon ruffles her unfeathered wings, showing tiny scales that rise and smooth out on their surface instead. &lt;strong&gt;Ownership is difficult concept, originally military weapon, military defunct Butlerian Empire fallen, Operator Kella recognized for initiative in seeking out DRAGON unit. Knowledge of old Empire plus DRAGON unit very high for new Dark Age. DRAGON unit is satisfied with arrangement does not wish to revise.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m touched, honestly, absurdly so, and I think this is the first time I&amp;#39;ve heard her actually express any sort of emotion or desire of her own, at least directly like that. &amp;quot;Satisfied with arrangement.&amp;quot; I suppose there are more eloquent ways to express that kind of sentiment—but I&amp;#39;ll take it just the same.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks,&amp;quot; I say, loudly enough for everyone listening to hear, and I&amp;#39;m suddenly aware of the wider scope to this little drama, all the other faces gathered round, watching, remembering.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This is a legend,&lt;/em&gt; I think, &lt;em&gt;someday parents will tell this story to their children, even if we fail people will remember this. I&amp;#39;m not sure if that makes me feel motivated or terrified. Probably plenty of both.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Operator Kella will do well,&lt;/em&gt; she sends back, and I suppose I should have realized she would catch all of that, I&amp;#39;m not exactly in a guarded moment. I send another thanks to her, silently this time, because I&amp;#39;ve also got to say something now, it&amp;#39;s expected, it&amp;#39;s right for the moment, and I&amp;#39;m not ready but&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;readiness is nice but now has the necessity&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;and I breathe in deep and let my gaze scan the little crowd, gathering larger every moment.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m no good at speeches, I&amp;#39;m just a scavver really,&amp;quot; I say. &amp;quot;Speeches were Dad&amp;#39;s thing. Some of you knew him, a few others knew the kind of thing he and Mom were always looking for. Well, now I&amp;#39;ve found it. Found &lt;em&gt;her&lt;/em&gt;. She still needs a name, but like I told Kether just a few moments ago, she&amp;#39;s the best hope we&amp;#39;ve had in a long, long time. We need to meet and talk about going forward. This place is fine for now but soon enough she&amp;#39;ll outgrow it, and we won&amp;#39;t evade fey notice for too long.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I close my eyes, knowing I shouldn&amp;#39;t, I should project confidence in front of this crowd, this should be a legendary speech for a legendary beginning, but humanity gets what it gets, it gets me, I&amp;#39;ll just do my best and that&amp;#39;s all they can ask, all I can ask of myself.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;That is all but best can improve, all can be added to, Operator Kella will have help grow with DRAGON unit not larger but other ways.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gods damn it all I&amp;#39;m sending again, but that&amp;#39;s alright, I send warmth back to her because that&amp;#39;s what the words give me and I don&amp;#39;t have time to process them right now even though they&amp;#39;re what I needed and I reach out, set my hand gently on the base of her neck, feeling what the little girl felt, surprisingly warm, dry and smooth-scaled.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Everyone is still looking at me, not seeming to mind the pause. The moment overspills with possibility and I reach for one. It&amp;#39;s the only one, it&amp;#39;s an awful one, maybe no one left alive now knows how awful, we know the grind of oppression but this is a different kind of milling-stone I&amp;#39;m about to set in motion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We can no longer just do what we can from the shadows, we will still need secrecy and guile on our side but now, we are going to become something else, now we are going to have to do something else.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I let my words sink in for a pause, purposeful this time, then stand up straight, fingers tightening on the base of her long neck, feeling that slight give, almost-living.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Now, we go to war.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kether&amp;#39;s eyes widen; I don&amp;#39;t have authority to declare anything like this, I don&amp;#39;t really have any authority at all. But I&amp;#39;ve said it, and people are listening, and I suppose that&amp;#39;s the only authority that really matters sometimes, and Kether&amp;#39;s about to speak but it&amp;#39;s cut off utterly.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The dragon roars.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My first thought, living here so long, is that it will attract the fey oh gods what are we going to do. But it won&amp;#39;t. No one knows what a dragon roar sounds like. Echoing down the streets, it could be one of their own half-tamed beasts making the noise. Certainly nothing human. Nothing to be concerned about.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Well, they&amp;#39;ll know the sound soon enough. It&amp;#39;s an extraordinary one, somehow metallic, only that&amp;#39;s not quite right. Crystalline. Ringing through the air with little hints of inner fire.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And the people roar back. That surprises me more. They roar their approval. They&amp;#39;re ready, maybe always have been, I don&amp;#39;t blame them, but I don&amp;#39;t think they know, I don&amp;#39;t think any of us do, just what&amp;#39;s coming, what it will mean.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;War.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Continued soon&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;come on by&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=\"/r/Magleby\"&gt;r/Magleby&lt;/a&gt; &lt;em&gt;for plenty more stories while you wait.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

How do you keep finding me?!\" My head jerks around wildly as I strain to listen for the slightest hint of Mephisto\\'s position. Sometimes I can make out a scraping sound against the wall, but I think he\\'s fucking with me at this point.\\n\\nMephisto continues to stand about thirty feet away. He\\'s allowing me to put some distance between us, but any notion of escape is an illusion at this point. \"Ksss... My minionsss include not only the dead, the damned, and the decrepit... but the bugsss asss well. While you flee, left and right, through thisss passsage and that... the wallsss part for me. I sssee you, no matter where you run. You will be mine...\"\\n\\n_He can communicate with insects?_\\n\\nA quick stomp of my foot illuminates the room around me. Here and there, tiny imperfections on the walls display various bugs crawling around.\\n\\n_Damn! This bastard never lets up! While I run up and down the hallways like a chicken with its head cut off, he can travel through the walls and show up right in front of me!_\\n\\n_Okay... okay... if that\\'s the case, then focus! I can escape him! It isn\\'t impossible!_\\n\\nSeveral ideas appear in my mind. _Slay the bugs. Distract him. Fake left, but go right._\\n\\nHowever, there\\'s an even better idea. I don\\'t have to kill Mephisto\\'s spies if I can turn them against him.\\n\\nUnder my breath, I whisper, \"**Mirage. Shimmer. Illusion. Smoke.**\"\\n\\nAll around me, copies of my body appear. They\\'re hallucinations, fake Jasons to distract him. A cloud of smoke erupts, and my clones and I take off, racing away from the Duke. I shift left and right, dashing between each of my copies and shuffling them around.\\n\\nTo my surprise, I hear Mephisto hiss in anger. One of my copies registers a hit as he swings to hit them, his knife passing through their illusory body. I don\\'t look back, but instead smile as I hear him yell, \"What?! Foolisssh worm... you can\\'t ssstop me with tricksss! I\\'ll cut all of them to piecesss!\"\\n\\nEach of the mirages shares a mental link with me. When a path split appears up ahead, I run left with several hallucinations, while the others go right. _Every time you encounter a junction, break off from each other,_ I order them.\\n\\nThe mindless incorporeal copies don\\'t respond, but a tingle tells me they understand.\\n\\n_Good._ I continue running, and grumble as Mephisto lucks out and follows my crew and not the others. He continues to stab mirages one by one. When the next split appears, I whisper, \"**Waypoint.**\"\\n\\nIt\\'s only a hunch, but if this works, I might be onto something. Sometimes it\\'s almost funny how the threat of a demon chasing after me can get my almonds rolling.\\n\\nWordsmithing has infinite possible effects. Having played many video games in my life, I hypothesize that if I set a waypoint, I might be able to jump back to it. Teleportation is something I\\'ve strongly considered, but it also terrifies me. What if I teleport inside a wall and fuse into it? I could die!\\n\\nBut as everyone always says, there\\'s no time like the present. This Demon Duke won\\'t leave me alone!\\n\\nA split appears a hundred feet ahead. I scowl as the Duke of Mist slashes at yet another of my illusions, dissipating it into nothingness. \\n\\n_I have only a dozen mirages left. He\\'ll hit me soon. I don\\'t want that knife touching me._ The sensation of a million volts of electricity slamming into my spine was more than a _little_ unpleasant.\\n\\nWhen we split this time, I continue moving with only two clones. For a split-second, Mephisto pauses behind us and curses. \"Devilsss... what if thisss isssn\\'t even the right one?!\"\\n\\nHe relents a moment later and chases after me, making me grimace. _I almost lost him._\\n\\nOne slash, my rear mirage falls. Another slash, the final copy falls.\\n\\nUnder my breath, I choke out, \"**Waypoint. Return.**\"\\n\\nBoom.\\n\\nI vanish while running and reappear at my first checkpoint, slamming against the wall. The change of scenery only disorients me for a moment, and I quickly spot the bugs crawling on the walls. _Mephisto will figure out what I did within seconds. There\\'s no time to lose!_\\n\\n\"**Invisibility. Stealth.**\"\\n\\nTransforming my body in a way similar to Mephisto\\'s, I take off down the opposite corridor that I first went, heading left toward what I hope is freedom. My shoes become noiseless, neither squeaking nor scuffing the floor as I run. Without my sonar, I have no choice but to rely on my infrared vision to see.\\n\\nThis time, I spend an hour fleeing for my life. Left, right, up, down. Corridors and hallways pass me by the dozens. \\n\\nI slow down once I enter an area with several puddles splashed across the floor. My mental map tells me this biome is most likely a marine area, one with vast reservoirs of water.\\n\\nFireflies buzz about, here and there. The ones in the Labyrinth are significantly brighter than the ones I knew about on Earth, and they illuminate rooms like twenty-watt bulbs. They don\\'t do anything for me with my current vision, but seeing a lot of them means I must be nearing an area with a high monster density. Demons and monsters aren\\'t allowed to eat the fireflies.\\n\\nCreeping forth, I avoid puddles and squint at the ground, unable to make much out. My shoes produce no noise, and the cool temperature in this marine biome makes my infrared vision nearly worthless. My best bet is to follow the fireflies since they produce a small amount of heat as they buzz around and crawl on the Labyrinth\\'s walls.\\n\\n\"**Normalize,**\" I whisper, returning my body to its original loudness level. I keep the invisibility active, just in case. It\\'s slowly draining my energy, which is terrible, but at the same time, I don\\'t want to take any chances. Better to lay low and pray the Duke can\\'t find me.\\n\\nUsing my Telekinesis, I hover over the ground, slowly moving forward without splashing in puddles. Every so often, I grab a rock and tap the walls to light the way, but otherwise, I remain entirely silent.\\n\\nSplashing sounds in the distance, along with the voices of incredibly cute women, make my heart flutter. _Not this time,_ I think to myself. Sirens can go to hell.\\n\\n\"Oooh, hehehe...\" One of the girls coos to someone out of sight. As I draw closer to one walled-off alcove, a large opening reveals a massive demon with hulking armor sitting silently before a pool. Located before him is a giant pool of water, one where dozens of creatures splash around playfully. After a moment of observing them, I realize they aren\\'t sirens, but instead, mermaids.\\n\\n\"Barbatos, sweetie, are you feeling okay?\" One of the mermaids pulls herself out of the water and splashes onto the land beside the iron giant. I slow my hovering for a moment to observe their interaction. \"You were gone for over a month! Come on, take off all that armor, and we\\'ll show you a good time!\"\\n\\nThe demon shifts slightly, his heavy plates of steel grinding together. \"No need.\"\\n\\n\"I heard that nasty Black Witch hurt you! I can\\'t believe it, love! I thought you were invincible!\" While the mermaid crows at him, two others swim over and stop at the edge of the pool.\\n\\n\"Defeated. Yes. Agares, dead. I was lucky.\"\\n\\nThe demon\\'s voice is deep and ominous, yet tinged with sadness and melancholy. Only now do I remember his name. \\n\\n_Barbatos! He\\'s one of the Dukes of Hell! Shit. I can\\'t stay here. I barely escaped the last guy. What the fuck is wrong with me?_\\n\\nContinuing past the entrance, I start to hover away, only to freeze as Barbatos speaks. \"Intruder. Reveal yourself.\"\\n\\nMy heart slams. _Fuck that! This guy is the size of a mountain!_\\n\\nI land on my feet and start running, only to gasp in alarm. Without so much as disturbing the air, the metal monster appears in front of me.\\n\\n_Red flag! Danger!_ My mind screams at me to run, but I hesitate, unsure what my best move is.\\n\\nBarbatos stands, arms crossed. \"Show yourself.\"\\n\\nGuilty, I mutter under my breath, \"**Reveal.**\"\\n\\nAs my body reforms, the Duke\\'s helmet shifts slightly. \"Human?\"\\n\\n\"If it\\'s a fight you want,\" I say, raising my tiny fists and striking a pose, \"I\\'ll give it to you.\"\\n\\nBarbatos is several inches taller than me. His armor adds to his size, making him appear nearly eight feet tall. However, despite his intimidating appearance, the Duke makes no motion to fight. \"Sacred place. Leave. Never return.\"\\n\\nI stare dumbly. \"W-what? You\\'re letting me go?\"\\n\\n\"Fighting. War. Unending. Not for me. My creed. Protect friends only.\"\\n\\n\"Ohhh. O-okay then, big guy. Well, uh, th-thanks.\"\\n\\nSlowly, I take a few steps away, careful not to turn my back on him. The Duke doesn\\'t move. Returning from the direction I came, I creep past the mermaid alcove. \\n\\nTwo of the mermaids hiss at me. I ignore them.\\n\\nOnce my spherical vision can no longer make out Barbatos\\'s form in the distance, I turn and quicken my pace, vigilantly ensuring I don\\'t step in and puddles of water.\\n\\n_Never return,_ echoes Barbatos\\'s voice in my head.\\n\\nMy teeth grind together as I shiver in fear. _Hey man, no problem. I\\'m sorry I bugged ya, pal. Have fun with the mermaids!_\\n\\n............................................................\\n\\nSigh... today is getting worse minute by minute.\\n\\n\"Gwahaha! You lost him?! What an idiot!\" Bael roars and slaps his knee while guffawing at Mephisto. I stare Bael down until he realizes his laughter is annoying me. He tapers off and rubs his nose. \"Err, sorry, boss.\"\\n\\n\"Mephisto,\" I begin, turning away from Bael, \"Where did you last see the human?\"\\n\\nThe Duke of Mist twitches his boney fingers impatiently. \"Ksss. Emperor Diablo, the flessshbag wasss only inchesss in front of me, and then he disssappeared. Hisss copiesss sssplit up and made it difficult for me to follow.\"\\n\\nI nod slowly. \"So when you say he vanished, you mean you slashed the copy, and then it dissolved like the others?\"\\n\\nMephisto bows his head. \"Nay. The flessshbag vanissshed before I could ssstrike hisss back.\"\\n\\n\"Teleportation, then, in addition to illusory magic and a blade of light that can cut through anything. This Jason fellow has a veritable grab bag of powers. Damn. I should have questioned Beelzebub more about the human\\'s abilities. Defeating a Lord isn\\'t a small task, even if he is a Hero.\"\\n\\nBael rolls his eyes. \"I\\'ve seen some weak heroes in my life. Remember that guy with no legs?\"\\n\\n\"How could I forget?\"\\n\\n\"Dunno.\"\\n\\nA moment of silence passes while I contemplate how to capture this newly awakened Hero.\\n\\nBael glowers at me. \"Hey. Boss. Do... do you think that the sword Beelzebub saw was...\"\\n\\n\"Excalibur? Not a chance. If the human possessed Excalibur, we\\'d know by now. Hell itself could be rent in half if that weapon fell into a Hero\\'s hands.\"\\n\\nBael chuckles slightly. \"Hehe. Okay, good. I was a little worried, ya know?\"\\n\\n\"So am I,\" I mutter. \"A Hero and the Black Queen. One alone under ordinary circumstances would be an emergency, but both at once...\"\\n\\nMephisto\\'s head twitches. \"I ssshould contact Umi. Ssshe is our bessst Oracle. Ssshe will help us find that flessshbag, and then-\"\\n\\n\"No. We have bigger problems to worry about.\" I hold up a palm to silence Mephisto. \"So far, Jason hasn\\'t caused us any problems. I\\'m much more worried about what he said regarding Amelia. If she\\'s alive and devouring another planet, we may be too late to stop her. We\\'ve already lost Agares, and the Overlords won\\'t take kindly to us requesting the destruction of a second planet. They\\'ll think me incompetent.\" \\n\\nI pause for a moment to consider my options. \"Mephisto, I want you to scour the Labyrinth and find out where that damn Belial is hiding. If she doesn\\'t help us, we\\'ll never defeat Amelia.\"\\n\\nBael\\'s smile melts away, and a look of worry crosses his face. \"Say, boss, what if when you fought the little witch, you used-\"\\n\\n\"No. Don\\'t even whisper what you\\'re thinking out loud. I\\'ll never unleash that power again.\" \\n\\nMephisto cocks his head curiously, but I don\\'t answer the question in his eyes.\\n\\n_I only used my power once. I damn near killed every other demon in existence. If I lose control like that again, nobody here will be able to stop me._\\n\\nAn Emperor\\'s job is to oversee all the other demons. I have to keep them alive, happy, and healthy... not necessarily in that order. Matters of war should almost always be for the Dukes. Besides, if I die, who will lead? Bael? Belial?\\n\\nNo. A recluse of a First Emperor, a whore of a Second, and an idiot for my First Duke. I\\'m the only remotely capable demon here.\\n\\nI wish it didn\\'t have to be that way. _Ruling is such a devil-damned pain in the ass._\\n\\n\"You heard me, Mephisto. Find Belial. No second-guessing my orders. Bael and I will hunt that human down. With luck, he\\'ll lead us right to the Black Queen... and checkmate.\"\\n\\n\"Keh keh keh... asss you command, Emperor Diablo.\" Mephisto says with a bow. A moment later, he turns around and fades into the wall.\\n\\nBael and I start walking down the passageway opposite where the human vanished. He nudges me. \"C\\'mon, boss. If you use your transformation when other demons ain\\'t around, there shouldn\\'t be a problem, right? The Black Bitch will be on a human planet! Nobody will get hurt but her!\"\\n\\nI nod. \"I know, Bael. However, that sick taste in my heart was something I never wish to experience again. It\\'s not something I can put into words.\"\\n\\nBael nods, and for once, he takes a moment to think before he speaks.\\n\\n\"Well, if that\\'s the way you feel, ain\\'t no way I\\'m convincin\\' ya. Anyway, I can\\'t wait to wrap my hands around the little bitch\\'s neck. Agares owed me three blood pies! Now I\\'ll never get \\'em!\"\\n\\n\"I\\'m glad you have your priorities in order,\" I mutter.\\n\\n\"Thanks, boss.\"\\n\\nSighing, I avert my eyes. _If Bael ever ran the Labyrinth; our kind would go extinct within a hundred years._\\n\\n_Count on it._\\n\\n.......................................\\n\\n**Author Note:**\\n\\n**[This is Barbatos with the mermaids.](https://i.imgur.com/BoJdIk6.jpg)**\\n\\n**[This is Barbatos with the mermaids, but an outdated character design.](https://i.imgur.com/UufEuP0.jpg)**',\n",

How do you keep finding me?!&amp;quot; My head jerks around wildly as I strain to listen for the slightest hint of Mephisto&amp;#39;s position. Sometimes I can make out a scraping sound against the wall, but I think he&amp;#39;s fucking with me at this point.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto continues to stand about thirty feet away. He&amp;#39;s allowing me to put some distance between us, but any notion of escape is an illusion at this point. &amp;quot;Ksss... My minionsss include not only the dead, the damned, and the decrepit... but the bugsss asss well. While you flee, left and right, through thisss passsage and that... the wallsss part for me. I sssee you, no matter where you run. You will be mine...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;He can communicate with insects?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A quick stomp of my foot illuminates the room around me. Here and there, tiny imperfections on the walls display various bugs crawling around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Damn! This bastard never lets up! While I run up and down the hallways like a chicken with its head cut off, he can travel through the walls and show up right in front of me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Okay... okay... if that&amp;#39;s the case, then focus! I can escape him! It isn&amp;#39;t impossible!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Several ideas appear in my mind. &lt;em&gt;Slay the bugs. Distract him. Fake left, but go right.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;However, there&amp;#39;s an even better idea. I don&amp;#39;t have to kill Mephisto&amp;#39;s spies if I can turn them against him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Under my breath, I whisper, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Mirage. Shimmer. Illusion. Smoke.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;All around me, copies of my body appear. They&amp;#39;re hallucinations, fake Jasons to distract him. A cloud of smoke erupts, and my clones and I take off, racing away from the Duke. I shift left and right, dashing between each of my copies and shuffling them around.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;To my surprise, I hear Mephisto hiss in anger. One of my copies registers a hit as he swings to hit them, his knife passing through their illusory body. I don&amp;#39;t look back, but instead smile as I hear him yell, &amp;quot;What?! Foolisssh worm... you can&amp;#39;t ssstop me with tricksss! I&amp;#39;ll cut all of them to piecesss!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Each of the mirages shares a mental link with me. When a path split appears up ahead, I run left with several hallucinations, while the others go right. &lt;em&gt;Every time you encounter a junction, break off from each other,&lt;/em&gt; I order them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The mindless incorporeal copies don&amp;#39;t respond, but a tingle tells me they understand.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good.&lt;/em&gt; I continue running, and grumble as Mephisto lucks out and follows my crew and not the others. He continues to stab mirages one by one. When the next split appears, I whisper, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Waypoint.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s only a hunch, but if this works, I might be onto something. Sometimes it&amp;#39;s almost funny how the threat of a demon chasing after me can get my almonds rolling.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Wordsmithing has infinite possible effects. Having played many video games in my life, I hypothesize that if I set a waypoint, I might be able to jump back to it. Teleportation is something I&amp;#39;ve strongly considered, but it also terrifies me. What if I teleport inside a wall and fuse into it? I could die!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But as everyone always says, there&amp;#39;s no time like the present. This Demon Duke won&amp;#39;t leave me alone!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A split appears a hundred feet ahead. I scowl as the Duke of Mist slashes at yet another of my illusions, dissipating it into nothingness. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I have only a dozen mirages left. He&amp;#39;ll hit me soon. I don&amp;#39;t want that knife touching me.&lt;/em&gt; The sensation of a million volts of electricity slamming into my spine was more than a &lt;em&gt;little&lt;/em&gt; unpleasant.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;When we split this time, I continue moving with only two clones. For a split-second, Mephisto pauses behind us and curses. &amp;quot;Devilsss... what if thisss isssn&amp;#39;t even the right one?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;He relents a moment later and chases after me, making me grimace. &lt;em&gt;I almost lost him.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One slash, my rear mirage falls. Another slash, the final copy falls.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Under my breath, I choke out, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Waypoint. Return.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Boom.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I vanish while running and reappear at my first checkpoint, slamming against the wall. The change of scenery only disorients me for a moment, and I quickly spot the bugs crawling on the walls. &lt;em&gt;Mephisto will figure out what I did within seconds. There&amp;#39;s no time to lose!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Invisibility. Stealth.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Transforming my body in a way similar to Mephisto&amp;#39;s, I take off down the opposite corridor that I first went, heading left toward what I hope is freedom. My shoes become noiseless, neither squeaking nor scuffing the floor as I run. Without my sonar, I have no choice but to rely on my infrared vision to see.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;This time, I spend an hour fleeing for my life. Left, right, up, down. Corridors and hallways pass me by the dozens. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I slow down once I enter an area with several puddles splashed across the floor. My mental map tells me this biome is most likely a marine area, one with vast reservoirs of water.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fireflies buzz about, here and there. The ones in the Labyrinth are significantly brighter than the ones I knew about on Earth, and they illuminate rooms like twenty-watt bulbs. They don&amp;#39;t do anything for me with my current vision, but seeing a lot of them means I must be nearing an area with a high monster density. Demons and monsters aren&amp;#39;t allowed to eat the fireflies.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Creeping forth, I avoid puddles and squint at the ground, unable to make much out. My shoes produce no noise, and the cool temperature in this marine biome makes my infrared vision nearly worthless. My best bet is to follow the fireflies since they produce a small amount of heat as they buzz around and crawl on the Labyrinth&amp;#39;s walls.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Normalize,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; I whisper, returning my body to its original loudness level. I keep the invisibility active, just in case. It&amp;#39;s slowly draining my energy, which is terrible, but at the same time, I don&amp;#39;t want to take any chances. Better to lay low and pray the Duke can&amp;#39;t find me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Using my Telekinesis, I hover over the ground, slowly moving forward without splashing in puddles. Every so often, I grab a rock and tap the walls to light the way, but otherwise, I remain entirely silent.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Splashing sounds in the distance, along with the voices of incredibly cute women, make my heart flutter. &lt;em&gt;Not this time,&lt;/em&gt; I think to myself. Sirens can go to hell.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oooh, hehehe...&amp;quot; One of the girls coos to someone out of sight. As I draw closer to one walled-off alcove, a large opening reveals a massive demon with hulking armor sitting silently before a pool. Located before him is a giant pool of water, one where dozens of creatures splash around playfully. After a moment of observing them, I realize they aren&amp;#39;t sirens, but instead, mermaids.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Barbatos, sweetie, are you feeling okay?&amp;quot; One of the mermaids pulls herself out of the water and splashes onto the land beside the iron giant. I slow my hovering for a moment to observe their interaction. &amp;quot;You were gone for over a month! Come on, take off all that armor, and we&amp;#39;ll show you a good time!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The demon shifts slightly, his heavy plates of steel grinding together. &amp;quot;No need.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I heard that nasty Black Witch hurt you! I can&amp;#39;t believe it, love! I thought you were invincible!&amp;quot; While the mermaid crows at him, two others swim over and stop at the edge of the pool.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Defeated. Yes. Agares, dead. I was lucky.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The demon&amp;#39;s voice is deep and ominous, yet tinged with sadness and melancholy. Only now do I remember his name. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Barbatos! He&amp;#39;s one of the Dukes of Hell! Shit. I can&amp;#39;t stay here. I barely escaped the last guy. What the fuck is wrong with me?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Continuing past the entrance, I start to hover away, only to freeze as Barbatos speaks. &amp;quot;Intruder. Reveal yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart slams. &lt;em&gt;Fuck that! This guy is the size of a mountain!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I land on my feet and start running, only to gasp in alarm. Without so much as disturbing the air, the metal monster appears in front of me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red flag! Danger!&lt;/em&gt; My mind screams at me to run, but I hesitate, unsure what my best move is.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Barbatos stands, arms crossed. &amp;quot;Show yourself.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Guilty, I mutter under my breath, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Reveal.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As my body reforms, the Duke&amp;#39;s helmet shifts slightly. &amp;quot;Human?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;If it&amp;#39;s a fight you want,&amp;quot; I say, raising my tiny fists and striking a pose, &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll give it to you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Barbatos is several inches taller than me. His armor adds to his size, making him appear nearly eight feet tall. However, despite his intimidating appearance, the Duke makes no motion to fight. &amp;quot;Sacred place. Leave. Never return.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I stare dumbly. &amp;quot;W-what? You&amp;#39;re letting me go?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fighting. War. Unending. Not for me. My creed. Protect friends only.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Ohhh. O-okay then, big guy. Well, uh, th-thanks.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowly, I take a few steps away, careful not to turn my back on him. The Duke doesn&amp;#39;t move. Returning from the direction I came, I creep past the mermaid alcove. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Two of the mermaids hiss at me. I ignore them.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Once my spherical vision can no longer make out Barbatos&amp;#39;s form in the distance, I turn and quicken my pace, vigilantly ensuring I don&amp;#39;t step in and puddles of water.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Never return,&lt;/em&gt; echoes Barbatos&amp;#39;s voice in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My teeth grind together as I shiver in fear. &lt;em&gt;Hey man, no problem. I&amp;#39;m sorry I bugged ya, pal. Have fun with the mermaids!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;............................................................&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sigh... today is getting worse minute by minute.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gwahaha! You lost him?! What an idiot!&amp;quot; Bael roars and slaps his knee while guffawing at Mephisto. I stare Bael down until he realizes his laughter is annoying me. He tapers off and rubs his nose. &amp;quot;Err, sorry, boss.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Mephisto,&amp;quot; I begin, turning away from Bael, &amp;quot;Where did you last see the human?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Duke of Mist twitches his boney fingers impatiently. &amp;quot;Ksss. Emperor Diablo, the flessshbag wasss only inchesss in front of me, and then he disssappeared. Hisss copiesss sssplit up and made it difficult for me to follow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nod slowly. &amp;quot;So when you say he vanished, you mean you slashed the copy, and then it dissolved like the others?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto bows his head. &amp;quot;Nay. The flessshbag vanissshed before I could ssstrike hisss back.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Teleportation, then, in addition to illusory magic and a blade of light that can cut through anything. This Jason fellow has a veritable grab bag of powers. Damn. I should have questioned Beelzebub more about the human&amp;#39;s abilities. Defeating a Lord isn&amp;#39;t a small task, even if he is a Hero.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael rolls his eyes. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve seen some weak heroes in my life. Remember that guy with no legs?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How could I forget?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Dunno.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A moment of silence passes while I contemplate how to capture this newly awakened Hero.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael glowers at me. &amp;quot;Hey. Boss. Do... do you think that the sword Beelzebub saw was...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Excalibur? Not a chance. If the human possessed Excalibur, we&amp;#39;d know by now. Hell itself could be rent in half if that weapon fell into a Hero&amp;#39;s hands.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael chuckles slightly. &amp;quot;Hehe. Okay, good. I was a little worried, ya know?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;So am I,&amp;quot; I mutter. &amp;quot;A Hero and the Black Queen. One alone under ordinary circumstances would be an emergency, but both at once...&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto&amp;#39;s head twitches. &amp;quot;I ssshould contact Umi. Ssshe is our bessst Oracle. Ssshe will help us find that flessshbag, and then-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. We have bigger problems to worry about.&amp;quot; I hold up a palm to silence Mephisto. &amp;quot;So far, Jason hasn&amp;#39;t caused us any problems. I&amp;#39;m much more worried about what he said regarding Amelia. If she&amp;#39;s alive and devouring another planet, we may be too late to stop her. We&amp;#39;ve already lost Agares, and the Overlords won&amp;#39;t take kindly to us requesting the destruction of a second planet. They&amp;#39;ll think me incompetent.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pause for a moment to consider my options. &amp;quot;Mephisto, I want you to scour the Labyrinth and find out where that damn Belial is hiding. If she doesn&amp;#39;t help us, we&amp;#39;ll never defeat Amelia.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael&amp;#39;s smile melts away, and a look of worry crosses his face. &amp;quot;Say, boss, what if when you fought the little witch, you used-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;No. Don&amp;#39;t even whisper what you&amp;#39;re thinking out loud. I&amp;#39;ll never unleash that power again.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto cocks his head curiously, but I don&amp;#39;t answer the question in his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I only used my power once. I damn near killed every other demon in existence. If I lose control like that again, nobody here will be able to stop me.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An Emperor&amp;#39;s job is to oversee all the other demons. I have to keep them alive, happy, and healthy... not necessarily in that order. Matters of war should almost always be for the Dukes. Besides, if I die, who will lead? Bael? Belial?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No. A recluse of a First Emperor, a whore of a Second, and an idiot for my First Duke. I&amp;#39;m the only remotely capable demon here.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I wish it didn&amp;#39;t have to be that way. &lt;em&gt;Ruling is such a devil-damned pain in the ass.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You heard me, Mephisto. Find Belial. No second-guessing my orders. Bael and I will hunt that human down. With luck, he&amp;#39;ll lead us right to the Black Queen... and checkmate.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keh keh keh... asss you command, Emperor Diablo.&amp;quot; Mephisto says with a bow. A moment later, he turns around and fades into the wall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael and I start walking down the passageway opposite where the human vanished. He nudges me. &amp;quot;C&amp;#39;mon, boss. If you use your transformation when other demons ain&amp;#39;t around, there shouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem, right? The Black Bitch will be on a human planet! Nobody will get hurt but her!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nod. &amp;quot;I know, Bael. However, that sick taste in my heart was something I never wish to experience again. It&amp;#39;s not something I can put into words.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Bael nods, and for once, he takes a moment to think before he speaks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Well, if that&amp;#39;s the way you feel, ain&amp;#39;t no way I&amp;#39;m convincin&amp;#39; ya. Anyway, I can&amp;#39;t wait to wrap my hands around the little bitch&amp;#39;s neck. Agares owed me three blood pies! Now I&amp;#39;ll never get &amp;#39;em!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m glad you have your priorities in order,&amp;quot; I mutter.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thanks, boss.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sighing, I avert my eyes. &lt;em&gt;If Bael ever ran the Labyrinth; our kind would go extinct within a hundred years.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Count on it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;.......................................&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Author Note:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/BoJdIk6.jpg\"&gt;This is Barbatos with the mermaids.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://i.imgur.com/UufEuP0.jpg\"&gt;This is Barbatos with the mermaids, but an outdated character design.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

Greg\\'s thoughts were drown out by the roar, and as it sped away he wondered why the feminine figure had on such immense padding. Her black leather bodysuit had seemed bulky in many places, and her sleek bike had two large black containers on either side of the rear wheel well. Greg wondered how she could ride hunched over and forward like she was for any kind of distance those travel bags implied.\\n\\n\"She seems to have somewhere to be. We\\'re going eighty and she just blew right by us!\" Greg told Kim, trying to small-talk her out of her concerned funk that had grown from her parents being unresponsive.\\n\\n\"Fuckin\\' crazy lady probably getting the fuck out of here before a mass fucking exodus,\" Kim ground out in a pained grumble. When the bike had roared by, her head had renewed its migraine intensity. She rubbed her head and drank some water. \"Or she\\'s heading the same direction we are. She just exited the same way we\\'re going. Fuckin cut off an auto-hauler too! Crazy bitch.\"\\n\\nGreg chuckled and rubbed her arm, trying to soothe her pained head. A moment later he exited the highway that circled the city, and saw John following behind do the same. Several hundred yards ahead down the access road he saw the biker turn off into the neighborhood that Kim\\'s parent\\'s lived in. He glanced over to see Kim had her eyes shut, and decided to keep the further coincidence to himself. By the time he took the turn into the rich neighborhood, the biker was nowhere to be seen.\\n\\nFifteen minutes of driving past towering trees and massive properties lead the two-car caravan to a private drive that snaked up a large slope. The drive was gated, but Kim reminded him of the code and Greg pulled forward enough for John to follow them in. Climbing the hill was difficult for the over-loaded stolen suburban, but a few minutes later Greg was rounding the top of the hill and cruising toward the six-car garage. Kim\\'s parents had built on a hill that was surrounded by several other hills. Once visibility of the full three stories was achieved it was only another hundred yards to the parking area. Greg smoothly pulled the car in beyond the massive garage and turned the corner to park in front of the guest house out of habit. His hand froze halfway to the shifter when he saw the sleek black and chrome bike leaning against the stone wall of the side entrance ramp to the house proper. A short-haired brunette was leaning against the wall with the bike, a motorcycle helmet gripped in one hand, and a cigarette clutched in the first two fingers of the other.\\n\\n\"Who in the actual fuck is this lady and why is she at my parent\\'s house?\" Kim wondered aloud.\\n\\nGreg glanced to his left to see John staring at the brunette, a confused look on his face. \"I don\\'t know baby, but I\\'ll go find out what she wants. Maybe she knows your folks?\" Greg doubted that he would like the answer to his own question when a faint chill slid down his spine.\\n\\nThe tall brunette was taking a deep drag, both feet a fair distance apart, firmly planted on the ground, and didn\\'t break her staring contest with the clouds when Greg stepped from the vehicle and approached. He never took his eyes off her as he signalled John and Raven to stay in their car. Greg placed both hands on his daggers, stopping only five feet from the woman and her bike.\\n\\n\"You won\\'t need those for me. I\\'m human, and not here to hurt you.\" The woman spoke in a perfectly neutral accent. Each word exact, mundane, and direct. \"We are on the same side, you four and I. Kim\\'s parents aren\\'t here. I need to speak with Raven.\"\\n\\nGreg stood with his mouth half open, staring at the woman that still stared skyward. He had been about to speak when she had begun the exchange instead. Caught off guard by the quantity of information shoved into so few words, Greg closed his mouth to take a deep breath and smooth out his response. \"How do you know this house, and how do you know Kim and Raven? Why should I believe anything you say?\"\\n\\n\"Who the fuck are you, lady?!\" Kim yelled from her side of the suburban as she closed the passenger door and flung open the side door for Shadow to slink out.\\n\\nThe large cat crept around Greg to flank the woman from her other side. When Shadow rounded out her flank, she stared up quizzically at the right side of the woman\\'s face. After a moment of silent regard, Shadow glanced between Greg, Kim, John and Raven in their car, and back to the brunette, then sat down on her haunches to continue studying the woman. Greg\\'s eyebrow went up when he realized the large feline had failed to garner a reaction.\\n\\nThe woman took a deep drag of her cigarette, cracked a small grin while she exhaled, and spoke to the sky once more. \"I\\'ll get her question out of the way first. I am Officer Silver. Katelyn Silver is my actual name, so it only sounds like my bosses like weird code names. You can all call me Kate. As for your questions, Gregory, I don\\'t personally know any of you. I have however been tasked with a mission concerning all of you.\"\\n\\nGreg glanced back at John and Raven, both of whom were still in Raven\\'s SUV. The confused look on Raven\\'s face told Greg everything he needed to know. \"Well none of us know you, and we have our own things that we need to be seeing to, so have a good day and please get off this property.\"\\n\\nKate smirked, dropping her cigarette to the ground after a final drag. Finally looking away from the sky to glance at the ground as she stepped on her cigarette and twisted her heavy black combat boot to snuff the embers. Kate shifted without moving her feet to face Greg. He heard a squeak from Raven\\'s open window, and Kim brought forth fire, covering her right hand in a ball of swirling crimson flames. While Kate\\'s left eye was a striking blue, her right eye was what had drawn reactions. A silver orb with a dull blue light at its center sat where her natural born eye had once been. The eye\\'s blue light burned at Greg,  and he realized that Kate had a storm cloud growing behind her natural eye.\\n\\n\"I am sure you think to search this house yourself, but I assure you that it is quite empty. Now we only have five minutes for me to relay a message to Raven and get all four of you heading toward our objective.\" Kate maintained her glare on Greg as she flung her hand up at Kim before she could start on a tirade. \"My people are looking for your parents as we speak. Last report said that they were in Colorado. We\\'ll get them out too if you come with me and help us get ready. We\\'re on Enlightenment protocol, so I can freely answer any question I have the answers for later. For now, Raven\\'s dad demanded that we ensure her safe conduct to The Bastion.\"\\n\\nGreg\\'s eyes nearly fell from his head as he stared at the tall, imposing woman and tried to put together the barrage of information. She was nearly as tall as he, putting her at couple inches over six feet tall. No one made a sound for several heartbeats until Greg swallowed hard and took a step toward Raven\\'s door. \"Hand over the message and I\\'ll pass it to her, then.\"\\n\\n\"Very well. We are wasting time. We have less than four minutes to be away from here.\" Kate underhand tossed a small flat black square with a silvery dome in the center to Greg, who delicately caught the device in both hands. He passed it to Raven and she looked at the black and silver metal in confusion.\\n\\n\"Oh just put it on the dash and push down on the top. We Need To Go!\" Kate told Raven, emphasizing the last words with impatient urgency.\\n\\nRaven glared at the woman before doing as she had been told, her hand returning to her lap to clamp her other. The device then clicked softly several times before the multitude of small dimples on the silvery dome hissed open. Several hair-thin rods extended out four inches from the device. Small metal plates extended out from each rod to reach out and connect to the neighboring rods. In seconds the device had become a miniature satellite dish wish a soft blue glow emanating from its rim. Tiny beams of light streamed up into the center, and a cascade of light motes drifted up in a swirl. A sphere formed and shimmered, rippling with a static reminiscent of early television models.\\n\\nKate had gotten out another cigarette while everyone was glued to the high-tech device booting up. Greg reached out a hand, silently requesting a smoke. Kim grunted softly when Kate handed one over, a small bull\\'s snort coming from her nose. Greg pretended not to notice, lighting up as the image of an older man coalesced from the blue light on Raven\\'s dash. Color seeped into the image as it smoothed out into a white-haired tightly kept military man. His name tag was a blur, the image resolution failing to clarify the individual letters. Five stars formed a circle on the outer end of the top of each shoulder, along with several other insignias Greg didn\\'t recognize. He knew the five circular stars meant that the man was a five-star general, and that meant he was one of the most powerful men in the country, if not the world.\\n\\nRaven\\'s eyes glittered weekly with tears, a hand covering her shocked expression. \"Pops?\" She asked quietly, a tear sliding down her cheek as the image fully resolved.\\n\\nThe man\\'s hologram rubbed his throat, reached down out of view of the holo, and began to speak in a gruff baritone. \"Raven, I need you to go with Katelyn. I\\'m told you four are very short on time and need to be on the move. Tell Kate to inform Kim and Greg that their parents locations have been confirmed and they will be safe soon. We know you have questions, but there is no time for answering them right now. Kate is one of my best; she will keep you safe.\"\\n\\nRaven took in a slow, deep breath before sighing out a soft, \"Yes, sir.\"\\n\\n\"That\\'s my girl. Stay strong, and stay aware. You\\'re in more danger than you might know.\" The man\\'s image shifted toward Greg before continuing. \"Keep my little girl safe, but make sure you all make it out to The Bastion.\" The general turned to Kate then, \"Get going, officer. Stay safe, and godspeed.\" With that, the general nodded to Raven with a faint smile and reached down out of sight once more. \"I love you, little bird. I\\'ll see you soon,\" he said before the communication was cut.\\n\\n\"Okay, well then, uh.. I think I\\'m convinced. What now?\" Greg said, offering a shocked Kim a shrug and a shy grin.\\n\\n\"Fuck it, I\\'m sold. My parents would have come out here by now- the house would have alerted them to our being out here. Where the fuck is this bastion?\" Kim directed the last toward Kate.\\n\\nKate\\'s head whipped around to look toward the drive on the other side of the garages, took three long, powerful strides to her motorcycle, flipping open one of the saddle-bags. Several small black drones darted out, racing high into the air before circling out in a five mote spiral. \"Heat signatures detected on all sides. Five groups of six to ten un-identifieds. Closest is one-hundred and twenty eight yards out and coming up the drive. We took too long.\" Two black cubes appeared in her hands and she tossed one to Raven and the other to Kim. \"Communicators. The Bastion is a secure location to the west. I will not say more in as unsecure an environment as we are in.\"\\n\\nSeveral sharp whistling sounds came from five separate directions at the same time as Kate turned her engine over. \"The darter drones are luring away our uninvited guests. Mount up and stay close! Greg and Kim, take the rear. John- keep that thing ten feet off my ass. Let\\'s Move!\" Kate gave such strong orders that Greg found himself obeying immediately.\\n\\nShadow leapt from the side wall and slipped into the packed interior. Kim grunted irritably, closing the side door and hopping into the passenger seat once more. Greg heard the electric motor of Raven\\'s sleek SUV spin up the moment before he started his own. Kate lead John in a tight circle, turning toward the entry road without rounding the corner of the massive garage. Greg followed suit, but in the small rear parking area he only had enough room to get near to being in line without actually lining up straight. A dark howl reverberated off of the windows of the house and through their vehicles.\\n\\nKate\\'s raised left hand was held in a fist until a howl sounded again from another direction. Her hand formed a knife that slashed forward and straight out. Her other hand cranked the motorcycle\\'s throttle, launching her forward. John accelerated hard in an attempt to stay close, while Greg too floored the accelerator and tore away from the empty mansion. Greg heard several enraged howls from behind and beside them as they topped the main hill and began to weave down the slope.\\n\\nShadow began to growl from her cubby beneath the supplies, her tail thumping as it lashed the bottom and sides of the containers. Greg saw small black objects taking flight from the saddle-bags once again as Kate lead the procession, obviously holding back on her throttle to keep close to the vehicles. The drones darted out in all directions, with four streaking for the road outside of Kim\\'s parent\\'s property. Tires squealed as the two heavily burdened SUVs tore around the final curve of driveway and made for the main gate. The gate hung open limply, one of the drones perched atop the control box, which spat out sparks and smoke. Kate turned right onto the street before skidding her rear tire around her front in a dangerous, and loud, turn-about maneuver.\\n\\nThe small communicator crackled to life in Kim\\'s jacket pocket. \"LEFT! NOW!\" Kate\\'s voice was urgent, and she thrust her hand toward the ordered direction.\\n\\nJohn accelerated hard onto the open street, scattering random plant and tree debris as the car lurched crazily for a moment before leveling out. Greg followed suit, fishtailing heavily as the suburban\\'s heavy rear and contents shifted the vehicle to nearly perpendicular to the street. Greg heaved on the wheel and swung the rear back around before finally getting the vehicle straightened out and straining up the neighborhood street. Kate\\'s motorcycle roared by on the passenger side, and Greg saw a massive pistol gripped in her gloved left hand. A moment later an explosion came from several hundred feet behind them on the street leading to the property they had just abandoned.  The large column of fire was visible in the side view mirrors for the seconds before they crested the current hill.\\n\\nAnother explosion ripped through the woods on their left, prompting more howling. Greg could see the light from the blast and felt the car vibrate from the shockwave. Two heartbeats and two explosions later they were careening around a corner and onto the main road of the neighborhood.\\n\\nA slick black sports car swerved to avoid Kate as she flew out of the side street. \"Don\\'t brake!\" She ordered as she swerved into oncoming traffic, causing several vehicles to slam on their brakes and creating a gap in the light traffic for John and Greg to enter the street at speed.\\n\\nGreg took a deep, nerve filled breath and exhaled slowly before chuckling nervously and glancing at Kim. \"I think she might know what she\\'s doing, hun. This is goi-\"\\n\\nGreg cut his words off, his jaw snapping shut with a click. He saw a massive quadrupedal figure burst from the woods a hundred yards ahead, clearing the twelve foot security fence to the richest neighborhood in the area to land directly on an old sedan. The car crumpled and shattered as several massive spikes punched through roof, trunk, hood, and the street around it. The towering figure looked like a cross between wolf, rhinoceros and bramble patch. The four powerful legs had spikes protruding from each armor plated segment as well as the three joints on each leg. Instead of feet it looked to have several spiked appendages. The armored head looked like the spiked end of a medieval mace, spikes jutting out one, two, or even three feet in most directions.\\n\\nThe sharp angle of the beastly muzzle reminded Greg of a bird of prey until it opened wide to reveal hundreds of jagged black teeth. The massive jaws ripped open the vehicle it had landed on, ripping its driver in half. Cars crashed and came to swerving halts before the beast, and sped away in horror beyond it, the beast roared while dozens of hellhounds tore through the fence and onto the street. Two drones sped from Kate\\'s bike, one impacting the large beast as the other slammed into the iron fence. Two massive explosions tore through the area, now only twenty yards away from Greg. Kate was nearly beyond them and John was close behind her.\\n\\nThe beast roared, rounding angry more than hurt, and several hellhounds stumbled into the street, shaking their heads and stamping clawed feet. One sprinted into the street and lunged across the median at John and Raven\\'s vehicle. John swerved, almost managing to avoid the savage claws as one set of claws latched onto the very rear of the car\\'s left side. The hellhound skidded and bounced as John tried to dislodge the beast with erratic driving. Greg swerved too and kept the accelerator floored.\\n\\nThe massive spiked beast lumbered forward, dragging the crushed car for several yards before it dislodged, tearing away in a shriek of rending metal. Greg swerved to the opposite side of the street, managing to avoid the massive spiked arm that broke the street where they would have been.\\n\\nThe hellhound that had latched one claw onto Raven\\'s SUV began to pull itself up, getting a second clawed hand into the vehicle\\'s rear. John swerved hard, swinging around a vehicle at nearly seventy miles per hour and managed to clip the hellhound on the rear of the vehicle. The beast roared in anger at its lost grip on its prey even as it pinwheeled through the air several yards above the road.\\n\\nGreg swerved to avoid a car on the opposite side of the street as he wove his way through the chaos and auto-cars and hellhounds. He saw the hellhound get swung out wide on the rear of the SUV, but another one leapt for him from the median. Kim grunted in effort and he saw the hellhound rocket higher into the air, clearing the top of the suburban by many feet.\\n\\n\"FUCK!\" Kim shouted, drawing Greg\\'s attention back to their mad dash. She threw her hands out as Greg pulled the wheel and reflexively slammed the brakes in an effort to dodge the hellhound flying into their windshield. The beast had tumbled through the air to land perfectly on their hood the instant Greg had brought his attention forward again.\\n\\nThe hood of the vehicle caved in heavily as the beast rolled up it, slamming into the windshield in a spray of glass and flailing spiked and clawed appendages.',\n",

       "   'selftext_html': '&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=\"md\"&gt;&lt;p&gt;I want to apologize to all three of my readers for the huge delay on this! I have had an incredibly long couple of weeks that started with a fight and my house getting trashed and just ended with my girlfriend and I&amp;#39;s first ever art festival that we sold our things at. And a minor concussion. But hey, I&amp;#39;m not dead; I still exist! I&amp;#39;d also like to give a massive thanks to &lt;a href=\"/u/Plucium\"&gt;u/Plucium&lt;/a&gt; for being awesome and hitting me up to make sure everything was alright. Twas a giant morale boost, mate, so thank you! And as always, any critiques, spell checking, etc is very welcome and appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;[&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/cm4duc/primal_essence_ch1/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;First Chapter&lt;/a&gt;] [&lt;a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/d5eiik/primal_essence_ch_18/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;amp;utm_source=share\"&gt;Previous&lt;/a&gt;] [[Next]]&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A motorcycle engine roared as a sleek black and chrome bike raced by. Greg&amp;#39;s thoughts were drown out by the roar, and as it sped away he wondered why the feminine figure had on such immense padding. Her black leather bodysuit had seemed bulky in many places, and her sleek bike had two large black containers on either side of the rear wheel well. Greg wondered how she could ride hunched over and forward like she was for any kind of distance those travel bags implied.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;She seems to have somewhere to be. We&amp;#39;re going eighty and she just blew right by us!&amp;quot; Greg told Kim, trying to small-talk her out of her concerned funk that had grown from her parents being unresponsive.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuckin&amp;#39; crazy lady probably getting the fuck out of here before a mass fucking exodus,&amp;quot; Kim ground out in a pained grumble. When the bike had roared by, her head had renewed its migraine intensity. She rubbed her head and drank some water. &amp;quot;Or she&amp;#39;s heading the same direction we are. She just exited the same way we&amp;#39;re going. Fuckin cut off an auto-hauler too! Crazy bitch.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg chuckled and rubbed her arm, trying to soothe her pained head. A moment later he exited the highway that circled the city, and saw John following behind do the same. Several hundred yards ahead down the access road he saw the biker turn off into the neighborhood that Kim&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s lived in. He glanced over to see Kim had her eyes shut, and decided to keep the further coincidence to himself. By the time he took the turn into the rich neighborhood, the biker was nowhere to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Fifteen minutes of driving past towering trees and massive properties lead the two-car caravan to a private drive that snaked up a large slope. The drive was gated, but Kim reminded him of the code and Greg pulled forward enough for John to follow them in. Climbing the hill was difficult for the over-loaded stolen suburban, but a few minutes later Greg was rounding the top of the hill and cruising toward the six-car garage. Kim&amp;#39;s parents had built on a hill that was surrounded by several other hills. Once visibility of the full three stories was achieved it was only another hundred yards to the parking area. Greg smoothly pulled the car in beyond the massive garage and turned the corner to park in front of the guest house out of habit. His hand froze halfway to the shifter when he saw the sleek black and chrome bike leaning against the stone wall of the side entrance ramp to the house proper. A short-haired brunette was leaning against the wall with the bike, a motorcycle helmet gripped in one hand, and a cigarette clutched in the first two fingers of the other.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who in the actual fuck is this lady and why is she at my parent&amp;#39;s house?&amp;quot; Kim wondered aloud.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg glanced to his left to see John staring at the brunette, a confused look on his face. &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know baby, but I&amp;#39;ll go find out what she wants. Maybe she knows your folks?&amp;quot; Greg doubted that he would like the answer to his own question when a faint chill slid down his spine.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The tall brunette was taking a deep drag, both feet a fair distance apart, firmly planted on the ground, and didn&amp;#39;t break her staring contest with the clouds when Greg stepped from the vehicle and approached. He never took his eyes off her as he signalled John and Raven to stay in their car. Greg placed both hands on his daggers, stopping only five feet from the woman and her bike.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You won&amp;#39;t need those for me. I&amp;#39;m human, and not here to hurt you.&amp;quot; The woman spoke in a perfectly neutral accent. Each word exact, mundane, and direct. &amp;quot;We are on the same side, you four and I. Kim&amp;#39;s parents aren&amp;#39;t here. I need to speak with Raven.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg stood with his mouth half open, staring at the woman that still stared skyward. He had been about to speak when she had begun the exchange instead. Caught off guard by the quantity of information shoved into so few words, Greg closed his mouth to take a deep breath and smooth out his response. &amp;quot;How do you know this house, and how do you know Kim and Raven? Why should I believe anything you say?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Who the fuck are you, lady?!&amp;quot; Kim yelled from her side of the suburban as she closed the passenger door and flung open the side door for Shadow to slink out.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The large cat crept around Greg to flank the woman from her other side. When Shadow rounded out her flank, she stared up quizzically at the right side of the woman&amp;#39;s face. After a moment of silent regard, Shadow glanced between Greg, Kim, John and Raven in their car, and back to the brunette, then sat down on her haunches to continue studying the woman. Greg&amp;#39;s eyebrow went up when he realized the large feline had failed to garner a reaction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The woman took a deep drag of her cigarette, cracked a small grin while she exhaled, and spoke to the sky once more. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ll get her question out of the way first. I am Officer Silver. Katelyn Silver is my actual name, so it only sounds like my bosses like weird code names. You can all call me Kate. As for your questions, Gregory, I don&amp;#39;t personally know any of you. I have however been tasked with a mission concerning all of you.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg glanced back at John and Raven, both of whom were still in Raven&amp;#39;s SUV. The confused look on Raven&amp;#39;s face told Greg everything he needed to know. &amp;quot;Well none of us know you, and we have our own things that we need to be seeing to, so have a good day and please get off this property.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate smirked, dropping her cigarette to the ground after a final drag. Finally looking away from the sky to glance at the ground as she stepped on her cigarette and twisted her heavy black combat boot to snuff the embers. Kate shifted without moving her feet to face Greg. He heard a squeak from Raven&amp;#39;s open window, and Kim brought forth fire, covering her right hand in a ball of swirling crimson flames. While Kate&amp;#39;s left eye was a striking blue, her right eye was what had drawn reactions. A silver orb with a dull blue light at its center sat where her natural born eye had once been. The eye&amp;#39;s blue light burned at Greg,  and he realized that Kate had a storm cloud growing behind her natural eye.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I am sure you think to search this house yourself, but I assure you that it is quite empty. Now we only have five minutes for me to relay a message to Raven and get all four of you heading toward our objective.&amp;quot; Kate maintained her glare on Greg as she flung her hand up at Kim before she could start on a tirade. &amp;quot;My people are looking for your parents as we speak. Last report said that they were in Colorado. We&amp;#39;ll get them out too if you come with me and help us get ready. We&amp;#39;re on Enlightenment protocol, so I can freely answer any question I have the answers for later. For now, Raven&amp;#39;s dad demanded that we ensure her safe conduct to The Bastion.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg&amp;#39;s eyes nearly fell from his head as he stared at the tall, imposing woman and tried to put together the barrage of information. She was nearly as tall as he, putting her at couple inches over six feet tall. No one made a sound for several heartbeats until Greg swallowed hard and took a step toward Raven&amp;#39;s door. &amp;quot;Hand over the message and I&amp;#39;ll pass it to her, then.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Very well. We are wasting time. We have less than four minutes to be away from here.&amp;quot; Kate underhand tossed a small flat black square with a silvery dome in the center to Greg, who delicately caught the device in both hands. He passed it to Raven and she looked at the black and silver metal in confusion.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh just put it on the dash and push down on the top. We Need To Go!&amp;quot; Kate told Raven, emphasizing the last words with impatient urgency.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raven glared at the woman before doing as she had been told, her hand returning to her lap to clamp her other. The device then clicked softly several times before the multitude of small dimples on the silvery dome hissed open. Several hair-thin rods extended out four inches from the device. Small metal plates extended out from each rod to reach out and connect to the neighboring rods. In seconds the device had become a miniature satellite dish wish a soft blue glow emanating from its rim. Tiny beams of light streamed up into the center, and a cascade of light motes drifted up in a swirl. A sphere formed and shimmered, rippling with a static reminiscent of early television models.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate had gotten out another cigarette while everyone was glued to the high-tech device booting up. Greg reached out a hand, silently requesting a smoke. Kim grunted softly when Kate handed one over, a small bull&amp;#39;s snort coming from her nose. Greg pretended not to notice, lighting up as the image of an older man coalesced from the blue light on Raven&amp;#39;s dash. Color seeped into the image as it smoothed out into a white-haired tightly kept military man. His name tag was a blur, the image resolution failing to clarify the individual letters. Five stars formed a circle on the outer end of the top of each shoulder, along with several other insignias Greg didn&amp;#39;t recognize. He knew the five circular stars meant that the man was a five-star general, and that meant he was one of the most powerful men in the country, if not the world.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raven&amp;#39;s eyes glittered weekly with tears, a hand covering her shocked expression. &amp;quot;Pops?&amp;quot; She asked quietly, a tear sliding down her cheek as the image fully resolved.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The man&amp;#39;s hologram rubbed his throat, reached down out of view of the holo, and began to speak in a gruff baritone. &amp;quot;Raven, I need you to go with Katelyn. I&amp;#39;m told you four are very short on time and need to be on the move. Tell Kate to inform Kim and Greg that their parents locations have been confirmed and they will be safe soon. We know you have questions, but there is no time for answering them right now. Kate is one of my best; she will keep you safe.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Raven took in a slow, deep breath before sighing out a soft, &amp;quot;Yes, sir.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s my girl. Stay strong, and stay aware. You&amp;#39;re in more danger than you might know.&amp;quot; The man&amp;#39;s image shifted toward Greg before continuing. &amp;quot;Keep my little girl safe, but make sure you all make it out to The Bastion.&amp;quot; The general turned to Kate then, &amp;quot;Get going, officer. Stay safe, and godspeed.&amp;quot; With that, the general nodded to Raven with a faint smile and reached down out of sight once more. &amp;quot;I love you, little bird. I&amp;#39;ll see you soon,&amp;quot; he said before the communication was cut.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Okay, well then, uh.. I think I&amp;#39;m convinced. What now?&amp;quot; Greg said, offering a shocked Kim a shrug and a shy grin.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck it, I&amp;#39;m sold. My parents would have come out here by now- the house would have alerted them to our being out here. Where the fuck is this bastion?&amp;quot; Kim directed the last toward Kate.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate&amp;#39;s head whipped around to look toward the drive on the other side of the garages, took three long, powerful strides to her motorcycle, flipping open one of the saddle-bags. Several small black drones darted out, racing high into the air before circling out in a five mote spiral. &amp;quot;Heat signatures detected on all sides. Five groups of six to ten un-identifieds. Closest is one-hundred and twenty eight yards out and coming up the drive. We took too long.&amp;quot; Two black cubes appeared in her hands and she tossed one to Raven and the other to Kim. &amp;quot;Communicators. The Bastion is a secure location to the west. I will not say more in as unsecure an environment as we are in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Several sharp whistling sounds came from five separate directions at the same time as Kate turned her engine over. &amp;quot;The darter drones are luring away our uninvited guests. Mount up and stay close! Greg and Kim, take the rear. John- keep that thing ten feet off my ass. Let&amp;#39;s Move!&amp;quot; Kate gave such strong orders that Greg found himself obeying immediately.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shadow leapt from the side wall and slipped into the packed interior. Kim grunted irritably, closing the side door and hopping into the passenger seat once more. Greg heard the electric motor of Raven&amp;#39;s sleek SUV spin up the moment before he started his own. Kate lead John in a tight circle, turning toward the entry road without rounding the corner of the massive garage. Greg followed suit, but in the small rear parking area he only had enough room to get near to being in line without actually lining up straight. A dark howl reverberated off of the windows of the house and through their vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Kate&amp;#39;s raised left hand was held in a fist until a howl sounded again from another direction. Her hand formed a knife that slashed forward and straight out. Her other hand cranked the motorcycle&amp;#39;s throttle, launching her forward. John accelerated hard in an attempt to stay close, while Greg too floored the accelerator and tore away from the empty mansion. Greg heard several enraged howls from behind and beside them as they topped the main hill and began to weave down the slope.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Shadow began to growl from her cubby beneath the supplies, her tail thumping as it lashed the bottom and sides of the containers. Greg saw small black objects taking flight from the saddle-bags once again as Kate lead the procession, obviously holding back on her throttle to keep close to the vehicles. The drones darted out in all directions, with four streaking for the road outside of Kim&amp;#39;s parent&amp;#39;s property. Tires squealed as the two heavily burdened SUVs tore around the final curve of driveway and made for the main gate. The gate hung open limply, one of the drones perched atop the control box, which spat out sparks and smoke. Kate turned right onto the street before skidding her rear tire around her front in a dangerous, and loud, turn-about maneuver.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The small communicator crackled to life in Kim&amp;#39;s jacket pocket. &amp;quot;LEFT! NOW!&amp;quot; Kate&amp;#39;s voice was urgent, and she thrust her hand toward the ordered direction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;John accelerated hard onto the open street, scattering random plant and tree debris as the car lurched crazily for a moment before leveling out. Greg followed suit, fishtailing heavily as the suburban&amp;#39;s heavy rear and contents shifted the vehicle to nearly perpendicular to the street. Greg heaved on the wheel and swung the rear back around before finally getting the vehicle straightened out and straining up the neighborhood street. Kate&amp;#39;s motorcycle roared by on the passenger side, and Greg saw a massive pistol gripped in her gloved left hand. A moment later an explosion came from several hundred feet behind them on the street leading to the property they had just abandoned.  The large column of fire was visible in the side view mirrors for the seconds before they crested the current hill.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Another explosion ripped through the woods on their left, prompting more howling. Greg could see the light from the blast and felt the car vibrate from the shockwave. Two heartbeats and two explosions later they were careening around a corner and onto the main road of the neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A slick black sports car swerved to avoid Kate as she flew out of the side street. &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t brake!&amp;quot; She ordered as she swerved into oncoming traffic, causing several vehicles to slam on their brakes and creating a gap in the light traffic for John and Greg to enter the street at speed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg took a deep, nerve filled breath and exhaled slowly before chuckling nervously and glancing at Kim. &amp;quot;I think she might know what she&amp;#39;s doing, hun. This is goi-&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg cut his words off, his jaw snapping shut with a click. He saw a massive quadrupedal figure burst from the woods a hundred yards ahead, clearing the twelve foot security fence to the richest neighborhood in the area to land directly on an old sedan. The car crumpled and shattered as several massive spikes punched through roof, trunk, hood, and the street around it. The towering figure looked like a cross between wolf, rhinoceros and bramble patch. The four powerful legs had spikes protruding from each armor plated segment as well as the three joints on each leg. Instead of feet it looked to have several spiked appendages. The armored head looked like the spiked end of a medieval mace, spikes jutting out one, two, or even three feet in most directions.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The sharp angle of the beastly muzzle reminded Greg of a bird of prey until it opened wide to reveal hundreds of jagged black teeth. The massive jaws ripped open the vehicle it had landed on, ripping its driver in half. Cars crashed and came to swerving halts before the beast, and sped away in horror beyond it, the beast roared while dozens of hellhounds tore through the fence and onto the street. Two drones sped from Kate&amp;#39;s bike, one impacting the large beast as the other slammed into the iron fence. Two massive explosions tore through the area, now only twenty yards away from Greg. Kate was nearly beyond them and John was close behind her.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The beast roared, rounding angry more than hurt, and several hellhounds stumbled into the street, shaking their heads and stamping clawed feet. One sprinted into the street and lunged across the median at John and Raven&amp;#39;s vehicle. John swerved, almost managing to avoid the savage claws as one set of claws latched onto the very rear of the car&amp;#39;s left side. The hellhound skidded and bounced as John tried to dislodge the beast with erratic driving. Greg swerved too and kept the accelerator floored.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The massive spiked beast lumbered forward, dragging the crushed car for several yards before it dislodged, tearing away in a shriek of rending metal. Greg swerved to the opposite side of the street, managing to avoid the massive spiked arm that broke the street where they would have been.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The hellhound that had latched one claw onto Raven&amp;#39;s SUV began to pull itself up, getting a second clawed hand into the vehicle&amp;#39;s rear. John swerved hard, swinging around a vehicle at nearly seventy miles per hour and managed to clip the hellhound on the rear of the vehicle. The beast roared in anger at its lost grip on its prey even as it pinwheeled through the air several yards above the road.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Greg swerved to avoid a car on the opposite side of the street as he wove his way through the chaos and auto-cars and hellhounds. He saw the hellhound get swung out wide on the rear of the SUV, but another one leapt for him from the median. Kim grunted in effort and he saw the hellhound rocket higher into the air, clearing the top of the suburban by many feet.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;FUCK!&amp;quot; Kim shouted, drawing Greg&amp;#39;s attention back to their mad dash. She threw her hands out as Greg pulled the wheel and reflexively slammed the brakes in an effort to dodge the hellhound flying into their windshield. The beast had tumbled through the air to land perfectly on their hood the instant Greg had brought his attention forward again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The hood of the vehicle caved in heavily as the beast rolled up it, slamming into the windshield in a spray of glass and flailing spiked and clawed appendages.&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': \"  \\nMarshall, along with everyone on Katel, had heard stories of the *Starliner*. More of a city than a ship, the F.C. *Starliner* was humanity’s greatest engineering achievement. Stretching its ultra-reinforced steel hull more than five miles long and wide, the ship briefly turned day into night as it passed over planets. Due to the ship’s massive size, it was equipped with the largest hyper-speed drive ever constructed, which took over twenty-five years of work to complete. The ship was outfitted with the most sophisticated weapons system of its time. Billions upon billions of dollars were poured into turning Starliner into a fortress to last eons.    \\n  \\t\\n*Not that the Starliner ever needs weapons*, Marshall thought. The few pirates and scavengers foolish enough to challenge the might of the Federation were exterminated before they even were in the same system as *Starliner*. The ship was the most protected manmade asset in the known universe. It served the Federation in one simple, yet crucial, purpose: investigate the unknown. The ship traversed galaxies and beyond, in search of new life and resources. Whenever a new habitable planet or system was found, it was documented, and the *Starliner* and its entourage of Federation warships moved on. When intelligent life was found, a small dispatch of human soldiers and scientists was left behind to make the first contact, and the ship moved on.   \\n  \\nMarshall had never seen the *Starliner*, nor had anyone else on Katel. Katel, a class four agricultural planet with an atmosphere similar to earth, had been discovered well before the ship’s construction. Katel was mostly inhabited by a peaceful, albeit threatening-looking species known to humanity as the Golian. The Golian were vaguely humanoid, more so than most of the species in System 11. The average male Golian stood at the friendly height of approximately nine feet tall. When discovered by the first Federal Rangers in 2112 A.D., the Golian were placed under the category of “extremely dangerous species.” It was soon discovered that, regardless of their size and intimidating bone structures, the Golian simply tended to their fields. Human translating devices soon picked up the Golian language, and amicable relations were made. Humanity didn’t stay on Katel for long, save for a few. The Golian gravity was 1.3x that of earth, and Katel’s sun beat down harshly. The Golian body had appropriately adapted. Thick, muscular legs propelled powered through tough gravity and efficient body coolant systems kept them from overheating. For the few humans remained on Katel, life was uncomfortable but bearable. \\n  \\nMarshall was one of those humans. Or, rather, his ancestors were. Marshall had no idea why his forefathers had chosen to stay on Katel, but he suspected they were lured by the simple agricultural life that Katel had to offer. The Golian were more than willing to share the land, and humanity offered up various technologies as thanks. Marshall had tilled his family’s small farm for years, ever since his parents had passed. He grew odd mixture of crops brought from earth and crops native to Katel. These days, Marshall preferred to only deal with produce that was earth-originated.  \\n   \\n*Prefer not working with crops at all*, Marshall grimly thought. As Marshall stood on the crest of a lone hill looking over his family’s swaths of wheat, corn, barley, and more, he wished for the Federation to return. The Federation hadn’t visited Katel in over fifty years, far before Marshall was born. For all of the domestic bliss Katel could offer, the planet was lacking in one resource Marshall desired: starships. More specifically, those with a warp drive. Ever since Marshall had gotten his hands on the controls of his father’s clipper, nothing had held his interest quite like space travel. Of course, the Golian used short-range cargo freights to carry tradable goods from planet to planet, but system-to-system travel was out of the question. The technology simply wasn’t on Katel. The Federation, however, was always on the lookout for new pilots, whether that be for combat, exploration, cargo, or any number of tasks an intergalactic bureaucracy found itself burdened with. Unfortunately for Marshall, the Federation seemingly never searched for those pilots on Katel. The government could hardly be blamed; the planet wasn’t ripe for potential candidates to begin with. Despite the inclinations of his ancestors, Marshall was not content with life “on the land.” \\n  \\nMarshall saw movement flicker in the corner of his eye and turned his gaze to the sky. Three moons bright enough to be seen in the daytime dominated the sky, along with Katel’s sun, but they weren’t important to Marshall. A grin stretched across Marshall’s face as he realized the movement hadn’t been avian -- it was a ship. \\n  \\nThe mid-sized cruiser began its descent. Twin engines mounted to the side of a shining hull burned bright as they stabilized the spacecraft. Decals depicting half-naked human women decorated the hull, and gaudy LED lights flashed in all colors, inviting anyone in a mile radius to take a look. The man sitting inside laid on the self-installed horn, forcing Marshall to cover his ears. Berwin had never been one for subtlety. The craft landed, and Marshall could see the name of the ship marked in bright lettering: *Arrowhead*. \\n  \\nThere was an incredible *WHOOOOSH* as the cockpit opened, and Berwin climbed out. \\n    \\n“You son of a bitch, I didn’t think I’d see you for another month,” Marshall said, extending his hand. The other man took it and pulled Marshall in for an embrace.  \\n   \\n“Thought I’d surprise you! Wouldn’t want you getting too cooped up here,” Berwin’s voice rang out clear and deep. He took a moment to brush any dust out of his long overcoat. Marshall wondered to himself how long the big man would be able to bear the heat in a coat like that -- especially a black one. The coat tumbled down to his knees, which were covered by a pair of torn blue jeans. Combined with his full beard, the outfit was better suited for the freezing winds of Westfar than the brutal heat of Katel. Berwin appeared to be regretting his fashion choice. His round face gleamed with sweat that he wiped away with a cloth handkerchief stored in the lining of his jacket.  \\n   \\n“I found some more parts,” Berwin suddenly spouted. “Nothing that’ll get you too far, but it might help get that piece of junk of yours off the ground.”  \\n   \\n“At this point, I’ll take anything,” responded Marshall. Sitting outside of Marshall’s house was the bones of an old two-man clipper, which Marshall had bought from a Golian who had intended to scrap it. In its prime, the *Direct* would have rivaled the speeds of most racers. These days, the ship was nothing more than a hunk of metal and dead electronics. Most notably, the ship was lacking a core. Fusion cores, required for interplanetary travel, were hard to come by on a planet like Katel. For months, Marshall had been slowly restoring what he could of the vessel. Progress was slow. Marshall learned what he could from various books and Federation resources, but he desperately needed parts. Berwin, when he visited, brought whatever he could, but the trading business rarely brings one to Katel. Regardless, Berwin was here now. He gestured Marshall to take a look inside the storage compartment of his ship.  \\n   \\nAs Berwin opened the hatch, Marshall’s jaw dropped.   \\n  \\n“Wow,” he whispered. The compartment of the ship wasn’t large, but Berwin had made good use of his space. Pristine stabilizing fins were propped along the sides of the compartment, and fresh coolant coils were strewn along the bottom. A large, lead-lined barrel of plutonium was strapped tightly to the back of the cushy pilot’s chair. Marshall’s eyes, however, snapped to a covered lump that took up the majority of the cabin.  \\n   \\n“What’s that?”  \\n  \\nBerwin flashed a dry grin and took hold of the tarp. As he tore the cloth away, Marshall couldn’t help but smile himself. A fusion core sat there, gloriously, inviting Marshall.\\n     \\n“Where the hell did you get this?” Marshall crouched to inspect the gleaming finish of the core. “This is new. There’s no way you found this just lying around.”  \\n   \\n“You like it?” Berwin beamed. “I called in a couple of favors from an Azil I met years ago who owed me for a few things. He just so happens to be the manager of a certain TourTech manufacturing plant. Things go missing all the time in places like those.” Marshall reached for the core, but hesitated. “Go for it,” Berwin said. “It’s yours.” \\n   \\nMarshall’s hands didn’t move, but his hazel eyes met Berwin’s. “I can’t take this, Far, you know that. This is worth thousands of credits, and you could sell it for more.” \\n   \\nBerwin shrugged. “Consider it an early birthday present for whenever your birthday is. I don’t need it and nobody’s gonna get better use out of it than you. It’s got warp capability, but I couldn’t get you a warp drive.”   \\n  \\nMarshall stood up and pulled Berwin into another embrace.   \\n  \\nIn the following months, Marshall devoted every second of his free time to the *Direct*. Even after a day of harvesting, he toiled outside, working on the ship as his black hair dripped with sweat. The hot Katel sun beat down relentlessly on Marshall, but he pressed on. As the days passed, rusty plates of metal were cleaned or scrapped, shot coils were replaced, and hovering gear was fixed. The starship began to look, but more importantly, *feel*, like a starship. Berwin came and went, bringing other small accessories. Excluding the core, the only other part of importance was a brand-new canopy, capable of sealing both heat and oxygen to the cockpit. \\n    \\nThe ship was almost complete. Only the new core was left to be installed, and Marshall had decided to wait for Berwin. In the meantime, Marshall continued to till his lands. He had more than enough credits saved to leave Katel and sustain himself for months, if not years, but he needed something to keep him occupied.  \\n   \\nOn a particularly hot and dry day, Berwin returned. Marshall waved him down and excitedly showed him all of the progress that had made on the *Direct*. The starship was almost ready for flight. Not all of it looked pretty, and rust and scratches still marred the otherwise structurally sound metal, but it was close. The two friends lugged the core onto the ship, and work began. Marshall did most of the technical work, which, at this point, was routine. All of the vastly complex parts lay within the core -- hooking it up was doable, albeit tedious. The first civilian fusion cores were designed to somewhat resemble a high-tech automobile engine, for marketing purposes. The fusion core ran off of plutonium or other highly radioactive materials rather than the solar panels that powered Marshall’s various farming machinery. Federation warships and other large vessels were powered by multiple fusion cores linked together through industrial-strength carbon pipes. Of course, those ships were capable of warping, unlike Marshall’s.  \\n   \\n As far as Marshall knew, humanity was the first species to successfully build a fusion core, giving them a head start to explore the universe. Humanity slowly expanded onto any habitable planets in the Milky Way and was surprised how close life had been to earth. The first living creatures humanity had found were microbes, simple bacteria on a planet three light-years from earth. Those microbes were more than enough to fuel the flame of human curiosity. The race to find intelligent life had begun in full force, and humanity didn’t have to wait long. The Droning, a small, insect-like race named for the sound of their quick wings, was found on a planet just six parsecs from the earth. The Droning had been more technologically advanced than humanity had anticipated, living in the equivalent of humanity’s stone age. \\n   \\nEven after more and more life was discovered, there had been one pressing issue facing humanity: time. Even at light-speed travel with fusion cores, getting from planet to planet had taken ludicrous amounts of time. Scientists couldn’t figure out how to break the lightspeed barrier. At least, until the Federation created the first warp drive. To get around this universal speed limit, the warp drive, rather than attempting to break the speed of light, simply shortened the distance between objects. By tearing a small hole in spacetime, a ship could briefly warp reality at a centralized location and phase back in at any desired location. Suddenly, distances no man could have traveled in a lifetime were just months, days, or hours away. Humanity’s arm, championed by the Federation, reached further into the cosmos, obtaining almost limitless resources. \\n  \\n*Soon, I’ll be right up there with ‘em*, Marshall thought, as he finished connecting the final wires of the core. He opened the canopy, pulled himself up onto the torn leather of the pilot’s seat, and then flipped the ignition. \\n    \\n“Here goes nothing,” Marshall said to Berwin, sat close by on some grass. He gazed over the console, examining every button, switch, and knob. Light bulbs that would hopefully soon be blinking in various indicators dotted the console, dead. He flipped the ignition switch.   \\n  \\nThe Direct’s new engine, complete with a fusion core, roared to life. Berwin jumped to his feet and hollered in celebration, clapping his hands over his ears and shouted something lost in the sound of the ship’s system’s coming to life. Marshall threw his first in the air, smiling as he closed the canopy over himself. He felt his ears pop as the cabin pressurized. A heads up display soon appeared on the reinforced glass in front of him, detailing his oxygen levels, shield capacity, and fuel levels in flashing colors. Orange, blue, red, and practically every other color on the rainbow flashed as Marshall took a second to admire his handiwork. He breathed in the crisp, cool air that flowed over the coolant coils he had installed himself. Remembering Berwin, he flipped off the engine and vaulted himself down a few feet to meet his friend.  \\n   \\nMarshall extended his hand. “Man, this is all because of you. You know that, right?” He gestured to the *Direct*.   \\n  \\nBerwin flashed his trademark grin. “I’m not the one who put in the hours. This is your--” He let out a curt grunt as a blast of air slammed into him, knocking him to his knees. Marshall grabbed onto the steel bar designed for entering the cockpit and braced himself. Leaves and grass swirled around him, and his hair whipped violently around his head. Berwin’s long coat did the same as the wind grew stronger, more violent. Both men felt their ears pop as the air pressure around them plummeted.   \\n  \\n*BOOM*  \\n  \\nA thunderclap dominated the winds below, and the sun disappeared. Marshall yelled in pain as the sound crashed into his ears. His eyes attempted to readjust to the new relative darkness and scanned the sky. Where the sun should have been, only a dark shape hung in the air. It was impossible, but Marshall knew exactly what had come. His face slowly contorted into an odd look of awe. There was only one ship large enough to cast a shadow like this.  \\n   \\n“The *Starliner*,” Marshall whispered. As his eyes adjusted, he could see the vessel clearly. It was almost difficult to determine where the ship began and where it ended. The *Starliner* was roughly spherical, designed to house a small ecosystem. The hull was mainly constructed of reinforced steel that was meters thick and was designed to withstand any attack. However, the real defense came in the form of energy shields that coated every inch of the ship. When Marshall was a child, he once heard a rumor that the only time the ship had ever been directly struck by any long-range attack was during a Federation training exercise in which shields were intentionally dropped to practice evasive maneuvers. Looking at the ship in front of him, though, Marshall couldn’t imagine ever needing to flee from a fight. Starliner was the safest place in the galaxy in every sense of the word.\\n  \\n“It’s beautiful,” Berwin muttered, standing next to Marshall. “I never thought I’d see it with my own eyes.”   \\n  \\n*In nature, the most beautiful flowers and creatures tend to be the most dangerous. On a small exoplanet just outside of Katel’s system, the most common native plant was a small red flower. Fields holding nothing but venenum pulchritudo stretched for miles in all directions. The flower, when first discovered, was regaled for its diminutive beauty. At the center of the flower was an exquisite and defining pattern of folded petals in the shape of a diamond. Unfortunately, a few unlucky Rangers decided to surprise their partners back on earth with a vase of the exotic and unique flower. In the months to follow, those same loved ones waited for the Rangers' return that would never come. What the Rangers could not have known: when this small, pretty flower is picked, it releases a deadly neurotoxin both through a small toxic cloud and through razor-sharp thorns. These thorns pierced through the Ranger’s gloves, and they were dead in minutes, with no warning.* \\n   \\nThe *Starliner* opened fire on Katel. \\n\\n-----------------------------\",\n",

Three moons bright enough to be seen in the daytime dominated the sky, along with Katel’s sun, but they weren’t important to Marshall. A grin stretched across Marshall’s face as he realized the movement hadn’t been avian -- it was a ship. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The mid-sized cruiser began its descent. Twin engines mounted to the side of a shining hull burned bright as they stabilized the spacecraft. Decals depicting half-naked human women decorated the hull, and gaudy LED lights flashed in all colors, inviting anyone in a mile radius to take a look. The man sitting inside laid on the self-installed horn, forcing Marshall to cover his ears. Berwin had never been one for subtlety. The craft landed, and Marshall could see the name of the ship marked in bright lettering: &lt;em&gt;Arrowhead&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;There was an incredible &lt;em&gt;WHOOOOSH&lt;/em&gt; as the cockpit opened, and Berwin climbed out. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You son of a bitch, I didn’t think I’d see you for another month,” Marshall said, extending his hand. The other man took it and pulled Marshall in for an embrace.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Thought I’d surprise you! Wouldn’t want you getting too cooped up here,” Berwin’s voice rang out clear and deep. He took a moment to brush any dust out of his long overcoat. Marshall wondered to himself how long the big man would be able to bear the heat in a coat like that -- especially a black one. The coat tumbled down to his knees, which were covered by a pair of torn blue jeans. Combined with his full beard, the outfit was better suited for the freezing winds of Westfar than the brutal heat of Katel. Berwin appeared to be regretting his fashion choice. His round face gleamed with sweat that he wiped away with a cloth handkerchief stored in the lining of his jacket.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“I found some more parts,” Berwin suddenly spouted. “Nothing that’ll get you too far, but it might help get that piece of junk of yours off the ground.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“At this point, I’ll take anything,” responded Marshall. Sitting outside of Marshall’s house was the bones of an old two-man clipper, which Marshall had bought from a Golian who had intended to scrap it. In its prime, the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt; would have rivaled the speeds of most racers. These days, the ship was nothing more than a hunk of metal and dead electronics. Most notably, the ship was lacking a core. Fusion cores, required for interplanetary travel, were hard to come by on a planet like Katel. For months, Marshall had been slowly restoring what he could of the vessel. Progress was slow. Marshall learned what he could from various books and Federation resources, but he desperately needed parts. Berwin, when he visited, brought whatever he could, but the trading business rarely brings one to Katel. Regardless, Berwin was here now. He gestured Marshall to take a look inside the storage compartment of his ship.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As Berwin opened the hatch, Marshall’s jaw dropped.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Wow,” he whispered. The compartment of the ship wasn’t large, but Berwin had made good use of his space. Pristine stabilizing fins were propped along the sides of the compartment, and fresh coolant coils were strewn along the bottom. A large, lead-lined barrel of plutonium was strapped tightly to the back of the cushy pilot’s chair. Marshall’s eyes, however, snapped to a covered lump that took up the majority of the cabin.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“What’s that?”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Berwin flashed a dry grin and took hold of the tarp. As he tore the cloth away, Marshall couldn’t help but smile himself. A fusion core sat there, gloriously, inviting Marshall.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Where the hell did you get this?” Marshall crouched to inspect the gleaming finish of the core. “This is new. There’s no way you found this just lying around.”  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“You like it?” Berwin beamed. “I called in a couple of favors from an Azil I met years ago who owed me for a few things. He just so happens to be the manager of a certain TourTech manufacturing plant. Things go missing all the time in places like those.” Marshall reached for the core, but hesitated. “Go for it,” Berwin said. “It’s yours.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall’s hands didn’t move, but his hazel eyes met Berwin’s. “I can’t take this, Far, you know that. This is worth thousands of credits, and you could sell it for more.” &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Berwin shrugged. “Consider it an early birthday present for whenever your birthday is. I don’t need it and nobody’s gonna get better use out of it than you. It’s got warp capability, but I couldn’t get you a warp drive.”   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall stood up and pulled Berwin into another embrace.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;In the following months, Marshall devoted every second of his free time to the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt;. Even after a day of harvesting, he toiled outside, working on the ship as his black hair dripped with sweat. The hot Katel sun beat down relentlessly on Marshall, but he pressed on. As the days passed, rusty plates of metal were cleaned or scrapped, shot coils were replaced, and hovering gear was fixed. The starship began to look, but more importantly, &lt;em&gt;feel&lt;/em&gt;, like a starship. Berwin came and went, bringing other small accessories. Excluding the core, the only other part of importance was a brand-new canopy, capable of sealing both heat and oxygen to the cockpit. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The ship was almost complete. Only the new core was left to be installed, and Marshall had decided to wait for Berwin. In the meantime, Marshall continued to till his lands. He had more than enough credits saved to leave Katel and sustain himself for months, if not years, but he needed something to keep him occupied.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;On a particularly hot and dry day, Berwin returned. Marshall waved him down and excitedly showed him all of the progress that had made on the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt;. The starship was almost ready for flight. Not all of it looked pretty, and rust and scratches still marred the otherwise structurally sound metal, but it was close. The two friends lugged the core onto the ship, and work began. Marshall did most of the technical work, which, at this point, was routine. All of the vastly complex parts lay within the core -- hooking it up was doable, albeit tedious. The first civilian fusion cores were designed to somewhat resemble a high-tech automobile engine, for marketing purposes. The fusion core ran off of plutonium or other highly radioactive materials rather than the solar panels that powered Marshall’s various farming machinery. Federation warships and other large vessels were powered by multiple fusion cores linked together through industrial-strength carbon pipes. Of course, those ships were capable of warping, unlike Marshall’s.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As far as Marshall knew, humanity was the first species to successfully build a fusion core, giving them a head start to explore the universe. Humanity slowly expanded onto any habitable planets in the Milky Way and was surprised how close life had been to earth. The first living creatures humanity had found were microbes, simple bacteria on a planet three light-years from earth. Those microbes were more than enough to fuel the flame of human curiosity. The race to find intelligent life had begun in full force, and humanity didn’t have to wait long. The Droning, a small, insect-like race named for the sound of their quick wings, was found on a planet just six parsecs from the earth. The Droning had been more technologically advanced than humanity had anticipated, living in the equivalent of humanity’s stone age. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even after more and more life was discovered, there had been one pressing issue facing humanity: time. Even at light-speed travel with fusion cores, getting from planet to planet had taken ludicrous amounts of time. Scientists couldn’t figure out how to break the lightspeed barrier. At least, until the Federation created the first warp drive. To get around this universal speed limit, the warp drive, rather than attempting to break the speed of light, simply shortened the distance between objects. By tearing a small hole in spacetime, a ship could briefly warp reality at a centralized location and phase back in at any desired location. Suddenly, distances no man could have traveled in a lifetime were just months, days, or hours away. Humanity’s arm, championed by the Federation, reached further into the cosmos, obtaining almost limitless resources. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Soon, I’ll be right up there with ‘em&lt;/em&gt;, Marshall thought, as he finished connecting the final wires of the core. He opened the canopy, pulled himself up onto the torn leather of the pilot’s seat, and then flipped the ignition. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“Here goes nothing,” Marshall said to Berwin, sat close by on some grass. He gazed over the console, examining every button, switch, and knob. Light bulbs that would hopefully soon be blinking in various indicators dotted the console, dead. He flipped the ignition switch.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The Direct’s new engine, complete with a fusion core, roared to life. Berwin jumped to his feet and hollered in celebration, clapping his hands over his ears and shouted something lost in the sound of the ship’s system’s coming to life. Marshall threw his first in the air, smiling as he closed the canopy over himself. He felt his ears pop as the cabin pressurized. A heads up display soon appeared on the reinforced glass in front of him, detailing his oxygen levels, shield capacity, and fuel levels in flashing colors. Orange, blue, red, and practically every other color on the rainbow flashed as Marshall took a second to admire his handiwork. He breathed in the crisp, cool air that flowed over the coolant coils he had installed himself. Remembering Berwin, he flipped off the engine and vaulted himself down a few feet to meet his friend.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Marshall extended his hand. “Man, this is all because of you. You know that, right?” He gestured to the &lt;em&gt;Direct&lt;/em&gt;.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Berwin flashed his trademark grin. “I’m not the one who put in the hours. This is your--” He let out a curt grunt as a blast of air slammed into him, knocking him to his knees. Marshall grabbed onto the steel bar designed for entering the cockpit and braced himself. Leaves and grass swirled around him, and his hair whipped violently around his head. Berwin’s long coat did the same as the wind grew stronger, more violent. Both men felt their ears pop as the air pressure around them plummeted.   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;BOOM&lt;/em&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A thunderclap dominated the winds below, and the sun disappeared. Marshall yelled in pain as the sound crashed into his ears. His eyes attempted to readjust to the new relative darkness and scanned the sky. Where the sun should have been, only a dark shape hung in the air. It was impossible, but Marshall knew exactly what had come. His face slowly contorted into an odd look of awe. There was only one ship large enough to cast a shadow like this.  &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“The &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt;,” Marshall whispered. As his eyes adjusted, he could see the vessel clearly. It was almost difficult to determine where the ship began and where it ended. The &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt; was roughly spherical, designed to house a small ecosystem. The hull was mainly constructed of reinforced steel that was meters thick and was designed to withstand any attack. However, the real defense came in the form of energy shields that coated every inch of the ship. When Marshall was a child, he once heard a rumor that the only time the ship had ever been directly struck by any long-range attack was during a Federation training exercise in which shields were intentionally dropped to practice evasive maneuvers. Looking at the ship in front of him, though, Marshall couldn’t imagine ever needing to flee from a fight. Starliner was the safest place in the galaxy in every sense of the word.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;“It’s beautiful,” Berwin muttered, standing next to Marshall. “I never thought I’d see it with my own eyes.”   &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;In nature, the most beautiful flowers and creatures tend to be the most dangerous. On a small exoplanet just outside of Katel’s system, the most common native plant was a small red flower. Fields holding nothing but venenum pulchritudo stretched for miles in all directions. The flower, when first discovered, was regaled for its diminutive beauty. At the center of the flower was an exquisite and defining pattern of folded petals in the shape of a diamond. Unfortunately, a few unlucky Rangers decided to surprise their partners back on earth with a vase of the exotic and unique flower. In the months to follow, those same loved ones waited for the Rangers&amp;#39; return that would never come. What the Rangers could not have known: when this small, pretty flower is picked, it releases a deadly neurotoxin both through a small toxic cloud and through razor-sharp thorns. These thorns pierced through the Ranger’s gloves, and they were dead in minutes, with no warning.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Starliner&lt;/em&gt; opened fire on Katel. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'Based on feedback, I\\'m going to be doing my stories using github pages so that I can have conversations in a clearer manner.\\n\\nYou can find this story [here](https://hexicube.github.io/HFY/story-001.htm), with the planned layout.  \\nNote: I changed the first section to be first-person on that link.\\n\\nI\\'ll still post them here too, but the formatting might not be great in some areas.\\n\\n---\\n\\nThe past few months had been particularly fruitful for Lllarkerh. Not one but two new species had been discovered (by their own species no less), and whilst he had prepared raiding fleets for \"Human\" colonies given their small demeanour, lack of claws, and only two arms, the \"Oba\" colonies proved to be a better target given that their slug-like bodies make it particularly difficult to field weaponry. With those raids done with a few days prior, he was relaxing in his ambassador suite enjoying some recent spoils. As it turns out, they\\'re pretty good at making alcoholic beverages, possibly due to their biology.\\n\\nA notice appears on his desk. \"Hmm...\" barely escapes him, it\\'s a message from the Human ambassador, Tom Alberto.\\n\\n    [PERIOD 8 - MOMENT 343] Personal message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Gerno ambassador Lllarkerh Krando\\n    \\n    Larker,\\n    I would like to have a discussion before the coalition session you organised today.\\n    I have a feeling these two events are related.\\n    Meet me in my quarters at period 9.\\n    \\n    - Tom\\n\\n---\\n(following text is from Lllarkerh\\'s perspective)\\n\\nSeems like news travels fast, he must already know that I\\'m responsible for those raids. I suppose he wants to try and talk his way out of being next on the list, not that it will help of course. May as well entertain the notion at least, see if I can\\'t avoid losing a few troops if I can help it.\\n\\nEager to put Humanity in their place I set out for his quarters, bringing my portable computer with me. Portability was just about the only thing they\\'ve managed to bring to the coalition, I\\'m sure it\\'ll help demonstrate that they will only serve to improve our own species, plus it\\'s a long walk and I could do with a distraction.\\n\\nAfter filling myself in on the news and speculation surrounding the raids I\\'ve conducted, I\\'ve found myself arriving a few moments early at the Human ambassador quarters. Curiously enough, there\\'s a chair opposite the door that seems designed just for me, considering that I\\'m twice their size. There\\'s also a variety of other chairs for the other species, one of which lacks a backrest, which I\\'ve decided to use as a footrest.\\n\\nAcross the hall I can see a couple Humans talking to each other, with the occasional glance in my direction. Not content to let myself be the target of some joke, I get up and head in their direction.  \\nH1: \"-it\\'s crazy, do they not look in the mirror or something?\"  \\nH2: \"They look like- oh, here he comes...\"  \\nL: \"What is it? Spit it out!\" I demand, approaching a half-shout.  \\nH2: \"Well, uh...um...\" They\\'re both visibly shocked by my outburst.  \\nH1: \"You look like, uh, a bear with scales.\"  \\nA bear with scales? Pulling up my portable computer, I investigate what this bear is, only to find it remarkably similar to myself except with fur and not scales.  \\nL: \"I suppose I do, and are bears ferocious predators?\"  \\nH2: \"You could say that.\"  \\nL: \"Excellent.\"\\n\\nSeems like I might have the upper hand in our discussion. As I\\'m heading back to my chair, Tom exits from his quarters looking at a device on his wrist.  \\nT: \"Ah, right on time. Come in.\"  \\nHis quarters seem to be laid out for our discussion. Two chairs opposite one another, one for each of us, around a large table about 5 metres in diameter, with a lot of chairs set out to the side, he must have larger discussions frequently. The table itself is rather strange, it\\'s a particularly thin table and appears to be made of polished iron. There\\'s also about 20 notepads laid out around the table, seems like they\\'re still quite primitive in some ways.  \\nT: \"I see you\\'re a fan of our tables. They\\'re not really my type but they make quite the impression, I\\'m sure you\\'ll agree.\"  \\nPulling out my computer, a quick scan confirms my assumption. Iron, plus Chromium, and a little Carbon. Steel, not iron, which explains the thinness.\\n\\nAs we\\'re both taking our seats, I try to cut to the chase.  \\nL: \"Could we get to the point? The session is in a few cycles.\"  \\nT: \"Of course. I wish to avoid an unnecessary war.\"  \\nWar? Raids are commonplace, surely he can\\'t see this as declaration of war.  \\nL: \"We have no intention of going to war with the Oda.\"  \\nT: \"I wish to avoid *Humans* going to an unnecessary war *in defence of* the Oda.\"  \\nAh, pack mentality. I\\'ve seen it before, weak species banding together protecting one-another from predators.  \\nHe\\'s also quite blunt when he needs to be, I appreciate that. Too many ambassadors try to sneak out of subjects with words that lack real meaning. Reminds me of politicians.  \\nL: \"Perhaps you should concentrate on your own outposts before looking at those of another species? As I recall, you have yet to receive our...formal greeting.\"  \\nT: \"Are you planning on attacking our colonies?\"  \\nNow\\'s my chance, with an attack on his mind and the recent devastation of Oda outposts, maybe I can get a tribute instead of resorting to bloodshed.  \\nT: \"I would advise-\"  \\nAs he continues, I stand and slam both hands into his table. It makes a satisfying thunk that echoes in his quarters, taking several seconds to die out completely. However, Tom seems...unimpressed? Almost like I\\'m a child throwing a tantrum.\\n\\nRising to a shout, I set about breaking my foe verbally.  \\nL: \"Listen, and listen well. Once we\\'ve processed our \\'donation\\' from Oda, you\\'re next!\"  \\nTom slowly stands, not content to let it be a one-sided shouting contest.  \\nL: \"You\\'ll be fortunate to get off with just one outpost in the attack!\"  \\nIs he...rubbing the table?  \\nT: \"You pride yourself on physical strength, yes?\"  \\nHe\\'s strangely calm, almost too calm...  \\nL: \"We are the strongest species in the galaxy!\" I boast with pride.  \\nHe lets out a sigh, knowing his defeat.  \\nT: \"That\\'s a shame, I quite like this table.\"  \\nL: \"I do not care for your meaningless objects! You will pay tribute in one month or you will find-\"  \\nLifting one arm to near head level, he brings it down on his table with a shattering boom far outmatching my own. The table is visibly warped from the impact, and there\\'s a distinct hand-shaped dent a couple centimetres deep where he struck it.  \\nT: \"You are the *second* strongest species in the galaxy. You will return what you stole from the Oda.\" Calm, as always, despite the strike.  \\nL: \"Like hell we will! You can\\'t make demands of-\"  \\nHe strikes the table again, the table buckles further and the notepads laid out start sliding into the groove. A second hand-shaped dent remains in the table.\\n\\nI can\\'t back down. I won\\'t back down. This has to be a trick, he must have laid out the table specifically to have a weakened section in front of him, with the notepads added for effect. No advanced species would use such primitive tools in a place like this. Extending my claws, I set about scraping my side of the table, producing a satisfying screech as Tom recoils from the sound.  \\nSeeing how sheer strength and volume isn\\'t cutting it, I\\'ll have to go back to a more...diplomatic voice.  \\nL: \"You will pay tribute in one month. 3 million tonnes of iron, 1 mill-\"  \\nA third strike, this time with both hands, and the table breaks in two. Looking across the newly formed edge, it\\'s clear the table wasn\\'t tampered with, if anything the table looks thicker on his side. A sickly feeling creeps in as I realise I\\'m not the predator in this room, and for the first time my eyes catch his. I wish they never did.  \\nT: \"I will repeat my demands at the session.\"  \\nHis eyes bore into me, searching, probing, looking for more weakness. He has me, he knows he has me, and he knows I know.  \\nT: \"If you have any objections, feel free to voice them then. Get out.\"  \\nI try to think of a response, but nothing comes. He\\'s started to walk to my side of the table, running his fingers against the polished surface of this half of the table, producing an unsettling rubbing sound. He stops a couple metres away, staring straight at me, eyes full of fury despite the calm demeanour.  \\nBarely maintaining composure, I give a quick \"Very well.\" and head out. I need to get back to my quarters, a ground invasion probably isn\\'t the best course of action right now. I also need more alcohol.\\n\\n    [PERIOD 9 - MOMENT 11] Message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Human engineering\\n    \\n    Gene,\\n    I could do with another table.\\n    \\n    - Tom\\n-\\n    [PERIOD 9 - MOMENT 15] Message from Human engineering to Human ambassador Tom Alberto\\n    \\n    Again?

Not one but two new species had been discovered (by their own species no less), and whilst he had prepared raiding fleets for &amp;quot;Human&amp;quot; colonies given their small demeanour, lack of claws, and only two arms, the &amp;quot;Oba&amp;quot; colonies proved to be a better target given that their slug-like bodies make it particularly difficult to field weaponry. With those raids done with a few days prior, he was relaxing in his ambassador suite enjoying some recent spoils. As it turns out, they&amp;#39;re pretty good at making alcoholic beverages, possibly due to their biology.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A notice appears on his desk. &amp;quot;Hmm...&amp;quot; barely escapes him, it&amp;#39;s a message from the Human ambassador, Tom Alberto.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[PERIOD 8 - MOMENT 343] Personal message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Gerno ambassador Lllarkerh Krando\\n\\nLarker,\\nI would like to have a discussion before the coalition session you organised today.\\nI have a feeling these two events are related.\\nMeet me in my quarters at period 9.\\n\\n- Tom\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;hr/&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;(following text is from Lllarkerh&amp;#39;s perspective)&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like news travels fast, he must already know that I&amp;#39;m responsible for those raids. I suppose he wants to try and talk his way out of being next on the list, not that it will help of course. May as well entertain the notion at least, see if I can&amp;#39;t avoid losing a few troops if I can help it.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Eager to put Humanity in their place I set out for his quarters, bringing my portable computer with me. Portability was just about the only thing they&amp;#39;ve managed to bring to the coalition, I&amp;#39;m sure it&amp;#39;ll help demonstrate that they will only serve to improve our own species, plus it&amp;#39;s a long walk and I could do with a distraction.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After filling myself in on the news and speculation surrounding the raids I&amp;#39;ve conducted, I&amp;#39;ve found myself arriving a few moments early at the Human ambassador quarters. Curiously enough, there&amp;#39;s a chair opposite the door that seems designed just for me, considering that I&amp;#39;m twice their size. There&amp;#39;s also a variety of other chairs for the other species, one of which lacks a backrest, which I&amp;#39;ve decided to use as a footrest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Across the hall I can see a couple Humans talking to each other, with the occasional glance in my direction. Not content to let myself be the target of some joke, I get up and head in their direction.&lt;br/&gt;\\nH1: &amp;quot;-it&amp;#39;s crazy, do they not look in the mirror or something?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nH2: &amp;quot;They look like- oh, here he comes...&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;What is it? Spit it out!&amp;quot; I demand, approaching a half-shout.&lt;br/&gt;\\nH2: &amp;quot;Well, uh...um...&amp;quot; They&amp;#39;re both visibly shocked by my outburst.&lt;br/&gt;\\nH1: &amp;quot;You look like, uh, a bear with scales.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nA bear with scales? Pulling up my portable computer, I investigate what this bear is, only to find it remarkably similar to myself except with fur and not scales.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;I suppose I do, and are bears ferocious predators?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nH2: &amp;quot;You could say that.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;Excellent.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Seems like I might have the upper hand in our discussion. As I&amp;#39;m heading back to my chair, Tom exits from his quarters looking at a device on his wrist.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;Ah, right on time. Come in.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nHis quarters seem to be laid out for our discussion. Two chairs opposite one another, one for each of us, around a large table about 5 metres in diameter, with a lot of chairs set out to the side, he must have larger discussions frequently. The table itself is rather strange, it&amp;#39;s a particularly thin table and appears to be made of polished iron. There&amp;#39;s also about 20 notepads laid out around the table, seems like they&amp;#39;re still quite primitive in some ways.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;I see you&amp;#39;re a fan of our tables. They&amp;#39;re not really my type but they make quite the impression, I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll agree.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nPulling out my computer, a quick scan confirms my assumption. Iron, plus Chromium, and a little Carbon. Steel, not iron, which explains the thinness.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As we&amp;#39;re both taking our seats, I try to cut to the chase.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;Could we get to the point? The session is in a few cycles.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;Of course. I wish to avoid an unnecessary war.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nWar? Raids are commonplace, surely he can&amp;#39;t see this as declaration of war.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;We have no intention of going to war with the Oda.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;I wish to avoid &lt;em&gt;Humans&lt;/em&gt; going to an unnecessary war &lt;em&gt;in defence of&lt;/em&gt; the Oda.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nAh, pack mentality. I&amp;#39;ve seen it before, weak species banding together protecting one-another from predators.&lt;br/&gt;\\nHe&amp;#39;s also quite blunt when he needs to be, I appreciate that. Too many ambassadors try to sneak out of subjects with words that lack real meaning. Reminds me of politicians.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;Perhaps you should concentrate on your own outposts before looking at those of another species? As I recall, you have yet to receive our...formal greeting.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;Are you planning on attacking our colonies?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nNow&amp;#39;s my chance, with an attack on his mind and the recent devastation of Oda outposts, maybe I can get a tribute instead of resorting to bloodshed.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;I would advise-&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nAs he continues, I stand and slam both hands into his table. It makes a satisfying thunk that echoes in his quarters, taking several seconds to die out completely. However, Tom seems...unimpressed? Almost like I&amp;#39;m a child throwing a tantrum.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Rising to a shout, I set about breaking my foe verbally.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;Listen, and listen well. Once we&amp;#39;ve processed our &amp;#39;donation&amp;#39; from Oda, you&amp;#39;re next!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nTom slowly stands, not content to let it be a one-sided shouting contest.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;You&amp;#39;ll be fortunate to get off with just one outpost in the attack!&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nIs he...rubbing the table?&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;You pride yourself on physical strength, yes?&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nHe&amp;#39;s strangely calm, almost too calm...&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;We are the strongest species in the galaxy!&amp;quot; I boast with pride.&lt;br/&gt;\\nHe lets out a sigh, knowing his defeat.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;That&amp;#39;s a shame, I quite like this table.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;I do not care for your meaningless objects! You will pay tribute in one month or you will find-&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nLifting one arm to near head level, he brings it down on his table with a shattering boom far outmatching my own. The table is visibly warped from the impact, and there&amp;#39;s a distinct hand-shaped dent a couple centimetres deep where he struck it.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;You are the &lt;em&gt;second&lt;/em&gt; strongest species in the galaxy. You will return what you stole from the Oda.&amp;quot; Calm, as always, despite the strike.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;Like hell we will! You can&amp;#39;t make demands of-&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nHe strikes the table again, the table buckles further and the notepads laid out start sliding into the groove. A second hand-shaped dent remains in the table.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t back down. I won&amp;#39;t back down. This has to be a trick, he must have laid out the table specifically to have a weakened section in front of him, with the notepads added for effect. No advanced species would use such primitive tools in a place like this. Extending my claws, I set about scraping my side of the table, producing a satisfying screech as Tom recoils from the sound.&lt;br/&gt;\\nSeeing how sheer strength and volume isn&amp;#39;t cutting it, I&amp;#39;ll have to go back to a more...diplomatic voice.&lt;br/&gt;\\nL: &amp;quot;You will pay tribute in one month. 3 million tonnes of iron, 1 mill-&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nA third strike, this time with both hands, and the table breaks in two. Looking across the newly formed edge, it&amp;#39;s clear the table wasn&amp;#39;t tampered with, if anything the table looks thicker on his side. A sickly feeling creeps in as I realise I&amp;#39;m not the predator in this room, and for the first time my eyes catch his. I wish they never did.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;I will repeat my demands at the session.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nHis eyes bore into me, searching, probing, looking for more weakness. He has me, he knows he has me, and he knows I know.&lt;br/&gt;\\nT: &amp;quot;If you have any objections, feel free to voice them then. Get out.&amp;quot;&lt;br/&gt;\\nI try to think of a response, but nothing comes. He&amp;#39;s started to walk to my side of the table, running his fingers against the polished surface of this half of the table, producing an unsettling rubbing sound. He stops a couple metres away, staring straight at me, eyes full of fury despite the calm demeanour.&lt;br/&gt;\\nBarely maintaining composure, I give a quick &amp;quot;Very well.&amp;quot; and head out. I need to get back to my quarters, a ground invasion probably isn&amp;#39;t the best course of action right now. I also need more alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[PERIOD 9 - MOMENT 11] Message from Human ambassador Tom Alberto to Human engineering\\n\\nGene,\\nI could do with another table.\\n\\n- Tom\\n&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;\\n\\n&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;\\n\\n&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;[PERIOD 9 - MOMENT 15] Message from Human engineering to Human ambassador Tom Alberto\\n\\nAgain?

The downside is that it only outlines places and corridors I\\'ve been to, but at the same time, it does allow me to keep track of my route.\\n\\nSadly, the last two months were for nothing. I found several divine artifacts, but they were worthless. Amelia has grown stronger during all that time, while my gains were sparse.\\n\\nKeeping in contact with Hero City is easy enough. I can say \\'Call,\\' and speak to Phoebe, Neil, or anyone else as needed.\\n\\nDespite suffering some setbacks, I\\'m surprised at how smoothly things have gone. I ran into a Demon Lord, Beelzebub, but the guy was such a pushover that now I\\'m worried I may be the single person who stands between Amelia planet-level hunger. I\\'ve only faced Lords up to now, while Amelia defeated three Dukes at the same time. \\n\\nIf I can\\'t stop her, I don\\'t see how anyone can.\\n\\nSlowing down, I wipe my forehead, realizing I\\'m feeling quite tired. \"**Water.**\"\\n\\nA jug of icy cold water pops into existence before me, and I plop down for a moment to catch my breath. The liquid of the gods tastes incredible when I\\'m running around in the Labyrinth. Something about the ambient temperature here is always just a little too warm to be comfortable. I can cool myself down with Wordsmithing, but that unpleasant heat always comes creeping back.\\n\\nAnd of course, thinking about the heat gets me wondering about other things too. What produces oxygen in the Labyrinth? I know plants exist, but they\\'re all in the upper and outer sections.\\n\\n\"**Pizza,**\" I say, giving myself a slice of pepperoni deep-dish with stuffed crust. Mmm. Pizza on Earth never tasted so perfect. It\\'s cooked exactly the way I like.\\n\\nAs I chow on the food, a thought occurs to me. _It\\'s funny how I can use my internal spiritual energy to create food, water, and external sources of power. Then when I rest at night, my spiritual energy completely refills._\\n\\nThe more I think about them, the more I realize how utterly broken my abilities are. If I keep experimenting, I\\'m sure to find new ways to use my Wordsmithing.\\n\\nAfter drinking my fill, I jump to my feet and Wordsmith again. \"**Vaporize.**\" The jug of water vanishes from existence, leaving no trace behind for anyone to find. Gotta cover my tracks.\\n\\nI\\'ve been reflecting on Amelia a lot, lately. I haven\\'t stopped thinking about how I can put an end to her inhuman rampage since I left the Core. What if I vaporized her with my Wordsmithing? I could kill her, just like that. I could do the same to all the demons.\\n\\nBut... should I? Is it right for me to pass judgment on others?\\n\\nMy power is abnormal. It\\'s not something that should exist. Godlike, incredible potential shouldn\\'t be in the hands of any random human. So why do I have it? Was I chosen for a reason? Am I somehow superior to everyone else? What about Einstein? Wouldn\\'t he have made better use of Wordsmithing if God had given him the ability?\\n\\nNo. It\\'s random luck that I was the one bestowed with Wordsmithing. I may be a Hero, the descendant of mythical warriors, but I don\\'t consider myself legendary. I might be the last hope for humanity, but I feel like a child playing with a gun. My ability is a dangerous thing, something that might backfire and hurt the people I love.\\n\\nMy footsteps echo off the walls as I start walking down the corridor again.\\n\\n_I wonder if Phoebe thinks about me when she sleeps,_ my mind wanders. _I know I like to dream about her, though I can\\'t sleep in the wilds of the Labyrinth._\\n\\nIndeed, over the past two months, I\\'ve not slept even one time, instead choosing to use my slowly depleting mana reserves to keep myself awake. I don\\'t feel any aftereffects, so it must be working, but I can\\'t keep it up forever. Sooner or later I\\'ll need to catch a catnap and hope the demons don\\'t-\\n\\n_What was that?_\\n\\nA noise behind me makes me stop and listen. _Is that... clicking?_\\n\\nMoments pass. Nothing. Neither my sonar nor my infrared vision show any blips.\\n\\nGod, I\\'m getting jumpy. Maybe I should take a nap after all.\\n\\nA chill goes down my back as I continue walking. There\\'s nobody around, but I feel naked and defenseless. An eye watches me.\\n\\nOne or two minutes pass. The feeling intensifies. A sensation like a finger presses against my back, and I immediately jump forward and spin around. \"Who\\'s there?!\"\\n\\nA male voice replies. \"Ksss, I was carelesss.\" \\n\\nI can\\'t see any part of the man at all. There\\'s no heat, and he doesn\\'t show up in a way that my sonar can detect. \\n\\n\"I\\'ve found you, flessshbag. Your glowing eyesss are quite remarkable. I look forward to adding them to my collection.\"\\n\\n\"What... what the hell are you? A ghost?!\"\\n\\n\"Sssomething like that. I am Mephisssto, Duke of Missst. A pleasssure to make your acquaintance, keh keh keh.\" Mephisto coughs like a chain-smoker. I can only assume he\\'s laughing. \"It ssseemsss you\\'re having trouble ssseeing me. Looksss like thossse eyesss are jussst for ssshow.\"\\n\\nMy heart pounds in my chest. This... _thing_... is a Duke? It has an entirely different presence from that Beelzebub fellow. The killing intent ripples from it and spills around, creating a sense of dread in the back of my mind.\\n\\nWhile the Duke of Mist hisses and titters to himself, I quickly jerk my hand out. My Lightsaber flies off my belt, lands in my palm, and ignites. My backpack\\'s cord attachment snaps onto the lightsaber, and I swing wildly in front of me, trying to hit whoever the hell this new guy is. My slashes cut into the walls on either side, slicing out paths of molten dirt and stone wherever my weapon strikes.\\n\\nI jump back and stare silently, but I can\\'t tell if my attacks had any effect.\\n\\n\"Oh no, you got me,\" The Duke of Mist says, a mocking tone in his voice. \"Ohh, the pain. It hurtsss, I\\'m dyiiing.\" He drags the last syllable out, cranking his sarcasm meter to max levels.\\n\\nWhile Mephisto laughs to himself, I send out a wave of telekinetic energy, yanking rocks from the ceiling down and onto where I think he\\'s standing.\\n\\n_Crash! Crash!_\\n\\nThe ceiling collapses on Mephisto\\'s position, only for the Duke to laugh even more uproariously.\\n\\n\"Keh keh keh! Good effort, flessshbag. Ssstill, perhapsss Beelzebub wasss telling the truth. You appear to be a Hero, after all.\"\\n\\n\"I can\\'t hurt you? Not even a little bit?!\"\\n\\n\"You may attempt to ssstrike me if you pleassse, but...\" The Duke pauses for dramatic effect. \"Allow me to ssshow you how it\\'sss done.\"\\n\\nSuddenly, from the point on my back that I felt his touch a minute ago, a violent pain erupts, sending me sprawling to the floor, my lightsaber just barely missing my face by inches. Agony jolts up my spine in waves, as if currents of electricity are coursing through my internal organs.\\n\\n\"Gaahg! Hnnngh! Fuck! Shiiit!\"\\n\\nI nearly bite off my tongue as my body reflexively curls into the fetal position. I can\\'t make the pain stop at all! \\n\\nAfter a few moments of writhing, I blink back tears and remember my Wordsmithing. \"**N-Neutralize! Heal!**\"\\n\\nThe pain stops. I freeze and shiver on the ground for half a minute as nausea roils around in my stomach. Using my telekinesis, I deactivate my lightsaber so that I don\\'t kill myself by accident.\\n\\n\"Sssussspiciousss.\" Mephisto\\'s voice holds a note of caution. \"Ssstopping my Pain Inducement without making hand sssignsss... very unusssual.\"\\n\\nWith a force of will that makes my head spin, I leap to my feet and quickly dash away. _Jesus Christ! Mephisto isn\\'t fucking around! I can\\'t see him, and I can\\'t hurt him either!_\\n\\nScarcely have I made it fifty feet, when Mephisto\\'s voice appears in front of me, making me screech to a halt. \"Foul flessshbag! I wassn\\'t done ssspeaking! Ssshow ressspect to your new massster!\"\\n\\n\"Fuck that!\" I yell and wonder how the hell he got in front of me. \"**Wall!**\"\\n\\nThe entire Labyrinth shakes as a foot-thick barrier forms between us in less than a second, and I quickly rush back in the direction I just left. I don\\'t want to head back toward Beelzebub, but maybe if I put some distance between myself and Mephisto, there will be a side tunnel or two that-\\n\\n\"Insssolent human!\"\\n\\nMephisto\\'s voice appears in front of me yet again, making me scream in fright and stumble backward, landing on my ass. _This Duke can move through walls?! Who the fuck am I dealing with?!_\\n\\nBefore I can get up and run away, an iron fist pounds me in the chest. It knocks the wind out of me and sends me tumbling back head over heels.\\n\\nMy vision spins. The nausea from a few moments ago reappears in violent form, and I vomit all over, only to realize I\\'m on my back. The bile erupts and lands all over my face, neck, and chest.\\n\\n\"Kuh-clean! **Clean!**\" I belch the words out, and the vomit disappears, leaving me feeling minty fresh, yet still horribly sickened.\\n\\nI can\\'t see him. I can\\'t sense him. He\\'s a goddamn ghost, able to move faster than me and pass through walls. Compared to Beelzebub\\'s little fire-show, this Duke is unspeakably dangerous. Forget Amelia! If I can\\'t beat the Duke of Mist, I\\'m done for!\\n\\nA familiar sound catches my attention. Clicking. The sound I heard before. Staggering to my feet, my jaw drops as a massive wall of skeletons shambles toward me. These aren\\'t like the weak little buggers Beelzebub controlled. Their intricately shaped armor, enormous steel shields, and swords all speak to a level of power I haven\\'t seen before.\\n\\nEven so, skeletons usually wouldn\\'t be a problem, but with Mephisto lurking around, I can\\'t afford to treat them lightly. They\\'ll distract me while he circles around and jams a knife into my back.\\n\\n\"Keh keh keh... do you like my creationsss? I am the massster of Death in the Labyrinth.\" Mephisto\\'s voice is still a little ways away. He must have punched me and stayed in his spot. \"Reanimation isss trivial for one asss powerful asss I. The other Dukesss don\\'t underssstand the ssskill and danger involved in reanimation, but sssoon they will.\"\\n\\nMy breath comes in gasps. I need to escape, but the Duke of Mist moves faster than me. I can\\'t hurt him with ordinary attacks, nor can I slow him down with barriers.\\n\\n_Think, Jason, think!_\\n\\nI can\\'t. My head is still spinning from that spinal attack. I\\'m out of breath, exhausted, and facing a Demon Duke; one of the most powerful beings in the Labyrinth.\\n\\n_Amelia beat him in combat?!_\\n\\nYes, that\\'s right. She killed that Agares fellow, but Mephisto was one of the other two Dukes that were there. If the Scyther brothers weren\\'t lying, then that means he managed to escape unscathed. Perhaps Amelia couldn\\'t hurt him.\\n\\nFUCK!\\n\\nHow do I get out of this situation?!\\n\\nAn idea appears. _It\\'s worth a shot!_\\n\\n\"**Speed! Speed! Power! Power! Perception!**\"\\n\\nIf the Duke of Mist is fast, then I have to be faster!\\n\\nSpinning on my heel, I dash away, racing toward the fake wall I created. Unlike last time when I was with Amelia and I hyper-speed-dashed into the Great Doors of the Labyrinth Core, this time, my mind manages to keep up with the speed increase.\\n\\nI pound through the fake wall without stopping, rushing with all my might, occasionally yelling \"**Heal!**\" whenever the power threatens to tear my limbs apart.\\n\\nMinutes pass. I continue tearing down the Labyrinth halls at speeds approaching a hundred miles an hour. Left, right, through this path and that, I ignore my heart screaming in pain. Ultimately, I can\\'t maintain my mad dash and slow to a stop. My body aches as if death is moments away.\\n\\nGasping for breath, I speak again, \"**Normalize,**\" returning my body to its original state.\\n\\n\"**Wa... Water.**\"\\n\\nAs the jug of icy water appears in my hand, I lift it to take a drink.\\n\\nA voice whispers in my ear.\\n\\n\"Oopsss, you almossst lossst me.\"\\n\\n**[Next Part](https://reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dl41hl/the_cryopod_to_hell_033_stab_and_seek/?)**',\n",

The downside is that it only outlines places and corridors I&amp;#39;ve been to, but at the same time, it does allow me to keep track of my route.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Sadly, the last two months were for nothing. I found several divine artifacts, but they were worthless. Amelia has grown stronger during all that time, while my gains were sparse.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Keeping in contact with Hero City is easy enough. I can say &amp;#39;Call,&amp;#39; and speak to Phoebe, Neil, or anyone else as needed.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Despite suffering some setbacks, I&amp;#39;m surprised at how smoothly things have gone. I ran into a Demon Lord, Beelzebub, but the guy was such a pushover that now I&amp;#39;m worried I may be the single person who stands between Amelia planet-level hunger. I&amp;#39;ve only faced Lords up to now, while Amelia defeated three Dukes at the same time. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If I can&amp;#39;t stop her, I don&amp;#39;t see how anyone can.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Slowing down, I wipe my forehead, realizing I&amp;#39;m feeling quite tired. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Water.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A jug of icy cold water pops into existence before me, and I plop down for a moment to catch my breath. The liquid of the gods tastes incredible when I&amp;#39;m running around in the Labyrinth. Something about the ambient temperature here is always just a little too warm to be comfortable. I can cool myself down with Wordsmithing, but that unpleasant heat always comes creeping back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;And of course, thinking about the heat gets me wondering about other things too. What produces oxygen in the Labyrinth? I know plants exist, but they&amp;#39;re all in the upper and outer sections.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Pizza,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; I say, giving myself a slice of pepperoni deep-dish with stuffed crust. Mmm. Pizza on Earth never tasted so perfect. It&amp;#39;s cooked exactly the way I like.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As I chow on the food, a thought occurs to me. &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s funny how I can use my internal spiritual energy to create food, water, and external sources of power. Then when I rest at night, my spiritual energy completely refills.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The more I think about them, the more I realize how utterly broken my abilities are. If I keep experimenting, I&amp;#39;m sure to find new ways to use my Wordsmithing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After drinking my fill, I jump to my feet and Wordsmith again. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Vaporize.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; The jug of water vanishes from existence, leaving no trace behind for anyone to find. Gotta cover my tracks.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been reflecting on Amelia a lot, lately. I haven&amp;#39;t stopped thinking about how I can put an end to her inhuman rampage since I left the Core. What if I vaporized her with my Wordsmithing? I could kill her, just like that. I could do the same to all the demons.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;But... should I? Is it right for me to pass judgment on others?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My power is abnormal. It&amp;#39;s not something that should exist. Godlike, incredible potential shouldn&amp;#39;t be in the hands of any random human. So why do I have it? Was I chosen for a reason? Am I somehow superior to everyone else? What about Einstein? Wouldn&amp;#39;t he have made better use of Wordsmithing if God had given him the ability?&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;No. It&amp;#39;s random luck that I was the one bestowed with Wordsmithing. I may be a Hero, the descendant of mythical warriors, but I don&amp;#39;t consider myself legendary. I might be the last hope for humanity, but I feel like a child playing with a gun. My ability is a dangerous thing, something that might backfire and hurt the people I love.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My footsteps echo off the walls as I start walking down the corridor again.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I wonder if Phoebe thinks about me when she sleeps,&lt;/em&gt; my mind wanders. &lt;em&gt;I know I like to dream about her, though I can&amp;#39;t sleep in the wilds of the Labyrinth.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Indeed, over the past two months, I&amp;#39;ve not slept even one time, instead choosing to use my slowly depleting mana reserves to keep myself awake. I don&amp;#39;t feel any aftereffects, so it must be working, but I can&amp;#39;t keep it up forever. Sooner or later I&amp;#39;ll need to catch a catnap and hope the demons don&amp;#39;t-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What was that?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A noise behind me makes me stop and listen. &lt;em&gt;Is that... clicking?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Moments pass. Nothing. Neither my sonar nor my infrared vision show any blips.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;God, I&amp;#39;m getting jumpy. Maybe I should take a nap after all.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A chill goes down my back as I continue walking. There&amp;#39;s nobody around, but I feel naked and defenseless. An eye watches me.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;One or two minutes pass. The feeling intensifies. A sensation like a finger presses against my back, and I immediately jump forward and spin around. &amp;quot;Who&amp;#39;s there?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A male voice replies. &amp;quot;Ksss, I was carelesss.&amp;quot; &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t see any part of the man at all. There&amp;#39;s no heat, and he doesn&amp;#39;t show up in a way that my sonar can detect. &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I&amp;#39;ve found you, flessshbag. Your glowing eyesss are quite remarkable. I look forward to adding them to my collection.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What... what the hell are you? A ghost?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sssomething like that. I am Mephisssto, Duke of Missst. A pleasssure to make your acquaintance, keh keh keh.&amp;quot; Mephisto coughs like a chain-smoker. I can only assume he&amp;#39;s laughing. &amp;quot;It ssseemsss you&amp;#39;re having trouble ssseeing me. Looksss like thossse eyesss are jussst for ssshow.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My heart pounds in my chest. This... &lt;em&gt;thing&lt;/em&gt;... is a Duke? It has an entirely different presence from that Beelzebub fellow. The killing intent ripples from it and spills around, creating a sense of dread in the back of my mind.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While the Duke of Mist hisses and titters to himself, I quickly jerk my hand out. My Lightsaber flies off my belt, lands in my palm, and ignites. My backpack&amp;#39;s cord attachment snaps onto the lightsaber, and I swing wildly in front of me, trying to hit whoever the hell this new guy is. My slashes cut into the walls on either side, slicing out paths of molten dirt and stone wherever my weapon strikes.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I jump back and stare silently, but I can&amp;#39;t tell if my attacks had any effect.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no, you got me,&amp;quot; The Duke of Mist says, a mocking tone in his voice. &amp;quot;Ohh, the pain. It hurtsss, I&amp;#39;m dyiiing.&amp;quot; He drags the last syllable out, cranking his sarcasm meter to max levels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;While Mephisto laughs to himself, I send out a wave of telekinetic energy, yanking rocks from the ceiling down and onto where I think he&amp;#39;s standing.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Crash! Crash!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The ceiling collapses on Mephisto&amp;#39;s position, only for the Duke to laugh even more uproariously.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keh keh keh! Good effort, flessshbag. Ssstill, perhapsss Beelzebub wasss telling the truth. You appear to be a Hero, after all.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I can&amp;#39;t hurt you? Not even a little bit?!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;You may attempt to ssstrike me if you pleassse, but...&amp;quot; The Duke pauses for dramatic effect. &amp;quot;Allow me to ssshow you how it&amp;#39;sss done.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, from the point on my back that I felt his touch a minute ago, a violent pain erupts, sending me sprawling to the floor, my lightsaber just barely missing my face by inches. Agony jolts up my spine in waves, as if currents of electricity are coursing through my internal organs.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gaahg! Hnnngh! Fuck! Shiiit!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I nearly bite off my tongue as my body reflexively curls into the fetal position. I can&amp;#39;t make the pain stop at all! &lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;After a few moments of writhing, I blink back tears and remember my Wordsmithing. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;N-Neutralize! Heal!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The pain stops. I freeze and shiver on the ground for half a minute as nausea roils around in my stomach. Using my telekinesis, I deactivate my lightsaber so that I don&amp;#39;t kill myself by accident.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Sssussspiciousss.&amp;quot; Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice holds a note of caution. &amp;quot;Ssstopping my Pain Inducement without making hand sssignsss... very unusssual.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;With a force of will that makes my head spin, I leap to my feet and quickly dash away. &lt;em&gt;Jesus Christ! Mephisto isn&amp;#39;t fucking around! I can&amp;#39;t see him, and I can&amp;#39;t hurt him either!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Scarcely have I made it fifty feet, when Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice appears in front of me, making me screech to a halt. &amp;quot;Foul flessshbag! I wassn&amp;#39;t done ssspeaking! Ssshow ressspect to your new massster!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Fuck that!&amp;quot; I yell and wonder how the hell he got in front of me. &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Wall!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;The entire Labyrinth shakes as a foot-thick barrier forms between us in less than a second, and I quickly rush back in the direction I just left. I don&amp;#39;t want to head back toward Beelzebub, but maybe if I put some distance between myself and Mephisto, there will be a side tunnel or two that-&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Insssolent human!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice appears in front of me yet again, making me scream in fright and stumble backward, landing on my ass. &lt;em&gt;This Duke can move through walls?! Who the fuck am I dealing with?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Before I can get up and run away, an iron fist pounds me in the chest. It knocks the wind out of me and sends me tumbling back head over heels.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My vision spins. The nausea from a few moments ago reappears in violent form, and I vomit all over, only to realize I&amp;#39;m on my back. The bile erupts and lands all over my face, neck, and chest.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Kuh-clean! &lt;strong&gt;Clean!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; I belch the words out, and the vomit disappears, leaving me feeling minty fresh, yet still horribly sickened.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t see him. I can&amp;#39;t sense him. He&amp;#39;s a goddamn ghost, able to move faster than me and pass through walls. Compared to Beelzebub&amp;#39;s little fire-show, this Duke is unspeakably dangerous. Forget Amelia! If I can&amp;#39;t beat the Duke of Mist, I&amp;#39;m done for!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A familiar sound catches my attention. Clicking. The sound I heard before. Staggering to my feet, my jaw drops as a massive wall of skeletons shambles toward me. These aren&amp;#39;t like the weak little buggers Beelzebub controlled. Their intricately shaped armor, enormous steel shields, and swords all speak to a level of power I haven&amp;#39;t seen before.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Even so, skeletons usually wouldn&amp;#39;t be a problem, but with Mephisto lurking around, I can&amp;#39;t afford to treat them lightly. They&amp;#39;ll distract me while he circles around and jams a knife into my back.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Keh keh keh... do you like my creationsss? I am the massster of Death in the Labyrinth.&amp;quot; Mephisto&amp;#39;s voice is still a little ways away. He must have punched me and stayed in his spot. &amp;quot;Reanimation isss trivial for one asss powerful asss I. The other Dukesss don&amp;#39;t underssstand the ssskill and danger involved in reanimation, but sssoon they will.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;My breath comes in gasps. I need to escape, but the Duke of Mist moves faster than me. I can&amp;#39;t hurt him with ordinary attacks, nor can I slow him down with barriers.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Think, Jason, think!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t. My head is still spinning from that spinal attack. I&amp;#39;m out of breath, exhausted, and facing a Demon Duke; one of the most powerful beings in the Labyrinth.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Amelia beat him in combat?!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, that&amp;#39;s right. She killed that Agares fellow, but Mephisto was one of the other two Dukes that were there. If the Scyther brothers weren&amp;#39;t lying, then that means he managed to escape unscathed. Perhaps Amelia couldn&amp;#39;t hurt him.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;FUCK!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;How do I get out of this situation?!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;An idea appears. &lt;em&gt;It&amp;#39;s worth a shot!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Speed! Speed! Power! Power! Perception!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;If the Duke of Mist is fast, then I have to be faster!&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Spinning on my heel, I dash away, racing toward the fake wall I created. Unlike last time when I was with Amelia and I hyper-speed-dashed into the Great Doors of the Labyrinth Core, this time, my mind manages to keep up with the speed increase.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I pound through the fake wall without stopping, rushing with all my might, occasionally yelling &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Heal!&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; whenever the power threatens to tear my limbs apart.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Minutes pass. I continue tearing down the Labyrinth halls at speeds approaching a hundred miles an hour. Left, right, through this path and that, I ignore my heart screaming in pain. Ultimately, I can&amp;#39;t maintain my mad dash and slow to a stop. My body aches as if death is moments away.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Gasping for breath, I speak again, &amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Normalize,&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot; returning my body to its original state.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;strong&gt;Wa... Water.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;As the jug of icy water appears in my hand, I lift it to take a drink.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;A voice whispers in my ear.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oopsss, you almossst lossst me.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=\"https://reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/dl41hl/the_cryopod_to_hell_033_stab_and_seek/?\"&gt;Next Part&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- SC_ON --&gt;',\n",

       "   'selftext': 'From space, the rising of the red sun over the planet Larissa was a beautiful sight. To the inhabitants on the surface, however, it was a rather more mundane signal that the day\\'s duties were about to begin. The more discerning (or less sleep-deprived) might today have caught a slightly unusual bit of news on the morning broadcast: \"Alien probe recovered from orbit of brown dwarf. Archaeologists anticipate implications for cosmological understanding\". However, most of the students filtering into professor Sofia\\'s history class that day had overlooked the bulletin entirely, focusing instead on more pressing matters, such as the contents of their breakfast. It therefore caught almost everyone by surprise when the professor opened her lecture with the words \"Today, we rewrite all that you know about history!\"\\n\\nWhen the initial shocked silence finally started to give way anxious murmurings, the professor continued: \"As most of you know, the creation of life from its non-living, organic building blocks is exceedingly rare in the galaxy. Even in our most controlled laboratory settings, we only manage to do it artificially once for every million attempts. The odds suggest that on a galactic scale, such a thing is exceedingly rare. In fact, we can only say with certainty that it has happened twice.\"\\n\\n\"Professor, we all know this,\" one of the try-hards of the first row interjected. \"Of course you would know, Mnason\" replied the professor. \"But you must show some sympathy for the lesser of your peers, who might have foolishly chosen to spend their youths outside of their libraries\". As the laughter subsided, Mnason\\'s bent head told the professor that he would not interrupt again.\\n\\n\"Now, as you all know, we are the result of one of these successful acts of creation. The other is a mysterious ancient race of aliens, long gone by the time of our first, careful steps into space. All we have found of them are a few relics, decrepit space stations orbiting the carcasses of stars whose lights have long since dwindled into darkness, abandoned mining operations in the far reaches of dead solar systems. Nothing remains of their art, history or culture. Everything but the metal husks they used to inhabit has been blasted clean by aeons of solar wind.\"\\n\\n\"Why did they disappear, professor?\" asked a raised hand from the back of the lecture hall. Professor Sofia paused in thought for a while, before she replied \"honestly, we don\\'t really know. We have only ever found the traces of them around dead stars, so we think they preferred brighter stars than we do. It\\'s hard to imagine now, but the galaxy was once filled with light. Looking up at the night sky, your entire field of vision would have been filled with dots of white and blue\". The entire class was momentarily lost in imagination, trying to fill in the expanses between the scarce few red dots of the night sky they knew.\\n\\n\"We know that we live in an old galaxy. The dead stars far outnumber the living, and the living stars are tens and even hundreds of billions of years old. But until now, we had no clue just how ancient it really is. Did anybody pay attention to the news this morning?\" A few, scattered hands rose across the lecture theatre. \"Then you know that another alien probe was found. What the news won\\'t have told you yet, was that this one is fully intact.\" A gasp spread across the lecture theatre. \"Our archaeologists are examining it as we speak, but it appears to be a time capsule, an epitaph built by a race that knew it was dying. They must have left a message in case other life would arise after they had died. We are still deciphering the alien language, but the images and pieces of text we have translated so far are already shaking the foundations of our world view. The greatest shock is this: There used to be other galaxies! In fact, the aliens came from one!\"\\n\\nThe lecture theatre fell dead silent for a short second that nevertheless felt like an eternity. Everybody knew that beyond the edge of the galaxy lay nothingness. A vast expanse of darkness, an all-encompassing void in which nothing save the single known galaxy existed. Could other galaxies really have existed in that abyss? Where would they have gone?\\n\\nSofia continued, answering the collective question. \"From what we can decipher, the aliens tell us that there used to be as many galaxies in the sky as there are now dead stars in our galaxy. But the alien message tells of an expanding universe, in which countless other galaxies existed. The space between galaxies has since expanded so much that we can no longer see them.\"\\n\\n\"We have long thought that we were the only remaining intelligent life in the universe. Now we know that there might be other forms of life out there, floating away from us on their own galaxy!\". Another hand raised in the audience: \"Could we ever reach them?\". \"No,\" answered the professor. \"That window has closed. Not even light can travel between our galaxy and any other. The universe is old, and the age of intergalactic exploration was over long before our species even existed. We can never reach them.\"\\n\\nAnother silence fell over the lecture theatre, this time a depressed and sullen one. But professor Sofia\\'s closing words were enough to lift the somber mood a little. \"But even if they are beyond our reach, and we will never encounter another intelligent species, we might still have something in common. The ancient aliens came from another galaxy into ours; they might have crossed into others as well. Right now, forever out of our grasp, another form of life might nevertheless be exploring the same alien relics as we are. These travellers among the galaxies might be the final common thing in a universe that will never meet again.\"\\n\\nThat night, the first translated excerpt from the epitaph was released on the general news. It carried the picture of a blue planet orbiting a yellow sun, accompanied by the following inscription: \"We are the first; no one came before us, and no one has yet come after. We travelled across the darkness while the stars still burned as beacons. We were the Humans; we lived while the Universe was young.\"',\n",
